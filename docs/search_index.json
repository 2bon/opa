policy is a set of rules that governs the behavior of a service.\nPolicy-enablement empowers users to read, write, and manage these rules without\nneeding specialized development or operational expertise. When your users can\nimplement policies without recompiling your source code, then your service is\npolicy enabled.\nWhat is Policy?\nAll organizations have policies. Policies are essential to the long-term\nsuccess of organizations because they encode important knowledge about how to\ncomply with legal requirements, work within technical constraints, avoid\nrepeating mistakes, and so on.\nIn their simplest form, policies can be applied manually based on rules that\nare written down or conventions that are unspoken but permeate an\norganization’s culture. Policies may also be enforced with application logic or\nstatically configured at deploy time.\nWhat is Policy Enablement?\nPolicy-enabled services allow policies to be specified declaratively, updated\nat any time without recompiling or redeploying, and enforced automatically\n(which is especially valuable when decisions need to be made faster than\nhumanly possible). They make deployments more adaptable to changing business\nrequirements, improve the ability to discover violations and conflicts,\nincrease the consistency of policy compliance, and mitigate the risk of human\nerror.\nA policy-enabled service is able to answer questions by comparing relevant\ninput from its environment to policy statements written by administrators. For\nexample, a cloud computing service could answer questions such as:\n\nCan I add compute capacity?\nIn what regions can I add compute capacity?\nWhich instances are currently running in the wrong region?\n\nWhat is OPA?\nOPA is a lightweight general-purpose policy engine that can be co-located with\nyour service. You can integrate OPA as a sidecar, host-level daemon, or\nlibrary.\nServices offload policy decisions to OPA by executing queries. OPA evaluates\npolicies and data to produce query results (which are sent back to the client).\nPolicies are written in a high-level declarative language and can be loaded\ninto OPA via the filesystem or well-defined APIs.\nWhy use OPA?\n\n"},"how-does-opa-work.html":{"url":"how-does-opa-work.html","title":"How Does OPA Work?","keywords":"","body":"How Does OPA Work?\nOPA is a full-featured policy engine that offloads policy decisions from your service. You can think of it as a concierge for your service who can answer detailed questions on behalf of your users to meet their specific needs.\nOverview\nOPA’s RESTful APIs use JSON over HTTP so you and your users can integrate OPA with any programming language. At a high level, integrating OPA into your service involves:\n\nDeploying OPA alongside your service\nPushing relevant data about your service’s state into OPA’s document store\nOffloading some or all decision-making to OPA by querying it\n\nWhen your service is integrated with OPA, your users will be able author and deploy custom policies that control the behavior of your service’s policy-enabled features. Furthermore, users can publish data to OPA that is not available to your service about their own deployment context.\n\nIn the future, both your service and its users will be able to register for, and react to, notifications triggered when OPA detects a policy-relevant change.\nDeployment\nUnless you embed OPA as a Go library, you will deploy it alongside your service – either directly as an operating system daemon or inside a container. In this way, transactions will have low latency and availability will be determined through shared fate with your service.\nWhen OPA starts for the first time, it will not contain any policies or data. Policies and data can be added, removed, and modified at any time. For example: by deployment automation software or your service as it is deployed, by your service during an upgrade, or by administrators as needed.\nData and Policies\nThe primary unit of data in OPA is a document, which is similar to a JSON value. Documents typically correspond to single, self-contained objects and are capable of representing both primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) as well as structured types (objects, and arrays). Documents are created, read, updated, and deleted via OPA’s RESTful HTTP APIs.\n\nBase Documents\nSo-called base documents contain static, structured data stored in memory and optionally saved to disk for resiliency. Your service will publish and update base documents in order to describe its current state, and your users can do the same to include relevant data about the state of their own deployment context.\nBase documents are published and updated using OPA’s Data API. For example, the following request publishes a list of servers to OPA:\nPATCH https://example.com/v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json-patch+json\n\n[\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s1\",\n      \"name\": \"app\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\",\n        \"https\",\n        \"ssh\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\",\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s2\",\n      \"name\": \"db\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"mysql\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s3\",\n      \"name\": \"cache\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"memcache\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s4\",\n      \"name\": \"dev\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\",\n        \"https\",\n        \"ssh\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nPolicies\nPolicies are written using OPA’s purpose-built, declarative language Rego. Rego includes rich support for traversing nested documents and transforming data using syntax inspired by dictionary and array access in languages like Python and JSONPath. For detailed information about using Rego, see How Do I Write Policies?.\nEach Rego file defines a policy module using a collection of rules that describe the expected state of your service. Both your service and its users can publish and update policy modules using OPA’s Policy API. For example, the following request creates a policy with two rules (violations and public_servers) named “exempli-gratia”:\nPUT https://example.com/v1/policies/exempli-gratia HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport data.servers\nimport data.networks\nimport data.ports\n\nviolations[server] {\n    server = servers[_]\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n    public_servers[server] = true\n}\n\npublic_servers[server] {\n    server = servers[_]\n    server.ports[_] = ports[i].id\n    ports[i].networks[_] = networks[j].id\n    networks[j].public = true\n}\n\nA policy file must contain a single package declaration, which defines the path to the policy module and its rules (for example, data.opa.examples.violations – see The data Document for more information about accessing nested documents). The policy name itself (in this case, “exempli-gratia”) is only used to identify policies for file management purposes; it is not used otherwise.\nRules and Virtual Documents\nIn contrast to base documents, virtual documents embody the results of evaluating the rules included in policy modules. Virtual documents are computed when users publish new policy modules, update existing modules, run queries, and when any relevant base document is published or updated. Rules allow policy authors to write questions with yes-no answers (that is, predicates) and to generate structured values from raw data found in base documents as well as from intermediate data found in other virtual documents.\nThe data Document\nAll documents pushed into OPA or computed by rules are nested under a built-in root document named data.\n\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"servers\": [...],\n    \"ports\": [...],\n    \"networks\": [...],\n    \"opa\": {\n      \"examples\": {\n        \"violations\": [...],\n        \"public_servers\": [...]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAs a result, any document, base or virtual, can be accessed hierarchically starting from the root data node – either as an identifier:\nimport data.servers                            # Base document\nimport data.opa.examples.violations            # Virtual document\n\nor as a URI component in an HTTP request:\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\n\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/opa/examples/violations HTTP/1.1\n\nThe input Document\nIn some cases, to evaluate a policy, the query must specify additional documents\nas arguments.\nQuery arguments are nested under a built-in root document named input (similar to data).\n{\n  \"input\": {\n      \"method\": \"GET\",\n      \"path\": \"/servers/s2\",\n      \"user\": \"alice\"\n  }\n}\n\nQuery arguments can be accessed hierarchically starting from the root input\nnode:\nallow { input.user = \"alice\" }\n\nJust like state stored in OPA, documents supplied with the query can be aliased:\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport input.method\nimport input.user\n\n# allow \"bob\" to perform read-only operations\nallow { user = \"bob\"; method = \"GET\" }\n\n# allow \"alice\" to perform any operation\nallow { user = \"alice\" }\n\nPutting It All Together\nLet’s take a look at some documents representing the state of a hypothetical service and a policy module that uses this data. The following documents describe a set of servers, the protocols they use, the ports they open, and the networks those ports are connected to.\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"servers\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"s1\",\n        \"name\": \"app\",\n        \"protocols\": [\n          \"https\",\n          \"ssh\"\n        ],\n        \"ports\": [\n          \"p1\",\n          \"p2\",\n          \"p3\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"s2\",\n        \"name\": \"db\",\n        \"protocols\": [\n          \"mysql\"\n        ],\n        \"ports\": [\n          \"p3\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"s3\",\n        \"name\": \"cache\",\n        \"protocols\": [\n          \"memcache\",\n          \"http\"\n        ],\n        \"ports\": [\n          \"p3\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"s4\",\n        \"name\": \"dev\",\n        \"protocols\": [\n          \"http\"\n        ],\n        \"ports\": [\n          \"p1\",\n          \"p2\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"networks\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"n1\",\n        \"public\": false\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"n2\",\n        \"public\": false\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"n3\",\n        \"public\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"ports\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"p1\",\n        \"networks\": [\n          \"n1\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"p2\",\n        \"networks\": [\n          \"n3\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"p3\",\n        \"networks\": [\n          \"n2\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nWhen the data is published, we can use OPA’s API to inspect base documents like servers:\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\n\nThe response is an object that contains the array of servers:\n{\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s1\",\n      \"name\": \"app\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"https\",\n        \"ssh\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\",\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s2\",\n      \"name\": \"db\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"mysql\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s3\",\n      \"name\": \"cache\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"memcache\",\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s4\",\n      \"name\": \"dev\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nNow let’s write a policy that enumerates servers that are connected to public networks and that are using HTTP. These servers are violating a business rule that states that all public servers must use HTTPS.\n# This policy module belongs to the opa.examples package.\npackage opa.examples\n\n# Refer to data.servers as `servers`.\nimport data.servers\n# Refer to the data.networks as `networks`.\nimport data.networks\n# Refer to the data.ports as `ports`.\nimport data.ports\n\n# A server exists in the violations set if...\nviolations[server] {\n    # ...the server exists\n    server = servers[_]\n    # ...and any of the server’s protocols is HTTP\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n    # ...and the server is public.\n    public_servers[server] = true\n}\n\n# A server exists in the public_servers set if...\npublic_servers[server] {\n    # ...the server exists\n    server = servers[_]\n    # ...and the server is connected to a port\n    server.ports[_] = ports[i].id\n    # ...and the port is connected to a network\n    ports[i].networks[_] = networks[j].id\n    # ...and the network is public.\n    networks[j].public = true\n}\n\nNote that:\n\nRules consist of assertions about data stored in OPA. In this case, the assertions test for equality with, and membership of, values in the servers, networks, and ports documents.\nExpressions can reference elements in a collection using the [_] and [] syntax. OPA knows to evaluate such queries by iterating over each element in the corresponding collection.\nAssertions about elements in a collection are true if any of the elements match the expression, and are only false when none of the elements match. For example, ports[i].networks[_] = networks[j].id will be true whenever any element in ports[i].networks matches the id of any element in networks.\nExpressions can reference nested documents. For example, ports[i].networks[_] refers to each network ID listed in each port document.\nExpressions can reference virtual documents. For example, public_servers[server] = true matches only if server is in the list produced by the public_servers rule.\n\nAfter publishing this policy module, data will include additional documents corresponding to the module’s package declaration (opa.examples) and the virtual documents its rules generate.\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"servers\": [...],\n    \"networks\": [...],\n    \"ports\": [...],\n    \"opa\": {\n      \"examples\": {\n        \"violations\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"s4\",\n            \"name\": \"dev\",\n            \"protocols\": [\n              \"http\"\n            ],\n            \"ports\": [\n              \"p1\",\n              \"p2\"\n            ]\n          }\n        ],\n        \"public_servers\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"s1\",\n            \"name\": \"app\",\n            \"protocols\": [\n              \"https\",\n              \"ssh\"\n            ],\n            \"ports\": [\n              \"p1\",\n              \"p2\",\n              \"p3\"\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"id\": \"s4\",\n            \"name\": \"dev\",\n            \"protocols\": [\n              \"http\"\n            ],\n            \"ports\": [\n              \"p1\",\n              \"p2\"\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIf we use OPA’s API to inspect the violations virtual document…\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/opa/examples/violations HTTP/1.1\n\n…the response is the subset of the servers base document that use HTTP and are connected to a public network:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s4\",\n      \"name\": \"dev\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n"},"how-do-i-write-policies.html":{"url":"how-do-i-write-policies.html","title":"How Do I Write Policies?","keywords":"","body":"How Do I Write Policies?\nOPA is purpose built for reasoning about information represented in structured\ndocuments. The data that your service and its users publish can be inspected and\ntransformed using OPA’s native query language Rego.\nWhat is Rego?\nRego was inspired by Datalog, which is\na well understood, decades old query language. Rego extends Datalog to support\nstructured document models such as JSON.\nRego queries are assertions on data stored in OPA. These queries can be used to\ndefine policies that enumerate instances of data that violate the expected state\nof the system.\nWhy use Rego?\nUse Rego for defining policy that is easy to read and write.\nRego focuses on providing powerful support for referencing nested documents and\nensuring that queries are correct and unambiguous.\nRego is declarative so policy authors can focus on what queries should return\nrather than how queries should be executed. These queries are simpler and more\nconcise than the equivalent in an imperative language.\nLike other applications which support declarative query languages, OPA is able\nto optimize queries to improve performance.\nThe Basics\nThis section introduces the main aspects of Rego.\nThe simplest rule is a single expression and is defined in terms of a Scalar Value:\npi = 3.14159\n\nRules define the content of documents. We can query for the content of the pi document generated by the rule above:\n> pi\n3.14159\n\nRules can also be defined in terms of Composite Values:\nrect = {\"width\": 2, \"height\": 4}\n\nThe result:\n> rect\n{\n  \"height\": 4,\n  \"width\": 2\n}\n\nMany expressions are defined in terms of Equality. These expressions can be thought of as assertions. The simplest example of a rule containing an equality expression involves two scalar values:\nv { \"hello\" = \"world\" }\n\nWe can evaluate v to check if it is equal to true:\n> v = true\nfalse\n\nThe order of operands in an equality expression does not matter. The result is the same:\n> true = v\nfalse\n\nIf we evaluate v on its own, the REPL prints undefined because the body of the rule never evaluates to true. As a result, the document generated by the rule is not defined.\n> v\nundefined\n\nWe can define rules in terms of Variables as well:\nt { x = 42; y = 41; x > y }\n\nThe formal syntax uses the semicolon character ; to separate expressions. Rule\nbodies can separate expressions with newlines and omit the semicolon:\nt2 {\n    x = 42\n    y = 41\n    x > 1\n}\nWhen evaluating rule bodies, OPA searches for variable bindings that make all of\nthe expressions true. There may be multiple sets of bindings that make the rule\nbody true. The rule body can be understood intuitively as:\nexpression-1 AND expression-2 AND ... AND expression-N\nThe rule itself can be understood intuitvely as:\nrule-name IS value IF body\nIf the value is omitted, it defaults to true.\nWhen we query for the contents of t we see the obvious result:\n> t\ntrue\n\nThe order of expressions in a rule does not affect the document’s content:\ns {\n    x > y\n    y = 41\n    x = 42\n}\n\nThe query result is the same:\n> s\ntrue\n\nRego References help you refer to nested documents. For example:\nsites = [{\"name\": \"prod\"}, {\"name\": \"smoke1\"}, {\"name\": \"dev\"}]\n\nr { sites[i].name = \"prod\" }\n\nThe rule r above asserts that there exists (at least) one document within sites where the name attribute equals \"prod\".\nThe result:\n> r\ntrue\n\nWe can generalize the example above with a rule that defines a set document instead of a boolean document:\nq[name] { sites[i].name = name }\n\nWhen we query for q we obtain a set of names:\n> q[x]\n+----------+\n|    x     |\n+----------+\n| \"prod\"   |\n| \"smoke1\" |\n| \"dev\"    |\n+----------+\n\nWe can re-write the rule r from above to make use of q. We will call the new rule p:\np { q[\"prod\"] }\n\nThe result will be the same:\n> p\ntrue\n\nRules which have arguments can be queried with input values:\n> q[\"smoke2\"]\nundefined\n> q[\"dev\"]\ntrue\n\nIf you made it this far, congratulations!\nThis section introduced the main aspects of Rego. The rest of this document\nwalks through each part of the language in more detail.\nFor a concise reference, see the Language\nReference document.\nScalar Values\nScalar values are the simplest type of term in Rego. Scalar values can be Strings, numbers, booleans, or null.\nDocuments can be defined solely in terms of scalar values. This is useful for defining constants that are referenced in multiple places. For example:\ngreeting   = \"Hello\"\nmax_height = 42\npi         = 3.14159\nallowed    = true\nsentinel   = null\n\nThese documents can be queried like any other:\n> greeting\n\"Hello\"\n> max_height\n42\n> pi\n3.14159\n> allowed\ntrue\n> sentinel\nnull\n\nStrings\nRego supports two different types of syntax for declaring strings. The first is likely to be the most familiar: characters surrounded by double quotes.\nIn such strings, certain characters must be escaped to appear in the string, such as double quotes themselves, backslashes, etc. See the Language\nReference for a formal definition.\nThe other type of string declaration is a raw string declaration. These are made of characters surrounded by backticks (` ), with the exception\nthat raw strings may not contain backticks themselves. Raw strings are what they sound like: escape sequences are not interpreted, but instead taken\nas the literal text inside the backticks. For example, the raw string `hello\\there`  will be the text \"hello\\there\", not \"hello\" and \"here\"\nseparated by a tab.  Raw strings are particularly useful when constructing regular expressions for matching, as it eliminates the need to double\nescape special characters.\nA simple example is a regex to match a valid Rego variable. With a regular string, the regex is \"[a-zA-Z_]\\\\w*\", but with raw strings, it becomes `[a-zA-Z_]\\w*` .\nComposite Values\nComposite values define collections. In simple cases, composite values can be treated as constants like Scalar Values:\ncube = {\"width\": 3, \"height\": 4, \"depth\": 5}\n\nThe result:\n> cube.width\n3\n\nComposite values can also be defined in terms of Variables or References. For example:\n> a = 42; b = false; c = null; d = {\"a\": a, \"x\": [b, c]}\n+----+-------+------+---------------------------+\n| A  |   B   |  C   |             D             |\n+----+-------+------+---------------------------+\n| 42 | false | null | {\"a\":42,\"x\":[false,null]} |\n+----+-------+------+---------------------------+\n\nBy defining composite values in terms of variables and references, rules can define abstractions over raw data and other rules.\nSets\nIn addition to arrays and objects, Rego supports set values. Sets are unordered\ncollections of unique values. Just like other composite values, sets can be\ndefined in terms of scalars, variables, references, and other composite values.\nFor example:\n> s = {cube.width, cube.height, cube.depth}; count(s, n)\n+---+---------+\n| n |    s    |\n+---+---------+\n| 3 | [5,4,3] |\n+---+---------+\n\n\nSet documents are collections of values without keys. OPA represents set\ndocuments as arrays when serializing to JSON or other formats that do not\nsupport a set data type. The important distinction between sets and arrays or\nobjects is that sets are unkeyed while arrays and objects are keyed, i.e., you\ncannot refer to the index of an element within a set.\n\nWhen comparing sets, the order of elements does not matter:\n> {1,2,3} = {3,1,2}\ntrue\nBecause sets are unordered, variables inside sets must be unified with a ground\nvalue outside of the set. If the variable is not unified with a ground value\noutside the set, OPA will complain:\n> {1,2,3} = {3,x,2}\n1 error occurred: 1:1: rego_unsafe_var_error: var x is unsafe\n\nBecause sets share curly-brace syntax with objects, and an empty object is\ndefined with {}, an empty set has to be constructed with a different syntax:\n> count(set(), n)\n+---+\n| n |\n+---+\n| 0 |\n+---+\n\nVariables\nVariables are another kind of term in Rego. They appear in both the head and body of rules.\nVariables appearing in the head of a rule can be thought of as input and output of the rule. Unlike many programming languages, where a variable is either an input or an output, in Rego a variable is simultaneously an input and an output. If a query supplies a value for a variable, that variable is an input, and if the query does not supply a value for a variable, that variable is an output.\nFor example:\nsites = [\n    {\"name\": \"prod\"},\n    {\"name\": \"smoke1\"},\n    {\"name\": \"dev\"}\n]\n\nq[name] { sites[i].name = name }\n\nIn this case, we evaluate q with a variable x (which is not bound to a value). As as result, the query returns all of the site names.\n> q[x]\n+----------+\n|    x     |\n+----------+\n| \"prod\"   |\n| \"smoke1\" |\n| \"dev\"    |\n+----------+\n\nOn the other hand, if we evaluate q with an input value for name we can determine whether name exists in the document defined by q:\n> q[\"smoke2\"]\nundefined\n> q[\"dev\"]\ntrue\n\nVariables appearing in the head of a rule must also appear in a non-negated equality expression within the same rule. This property ensures that if the rule is evaluated and all of the expressions evaluate to true for some set of variable bindings, the variable in the head of the rule will be defined.\nReferences\nReferences are used to access nested documents.\nThe examples in this section use the data defined in the Examples section.\nThe simplest reference contains no variables. For example, the following reference returns the hostname of the second server in the first site document from our example data:\n> sites[0].servers[1].hostname\n\"helium\"\n\nReferences are typically written using the “dot-access” style. The canonical form does away with . and closely resembles dictionary lookup in a language such as Python:\n> sites[0][\"servers\"][1][\"hostname\"]\n\"helium\"\n\nBoth forms are valid, however, the dot-access style is typically more readable. Note that there are four cases where brackets must be used:\n\nString keys containing characters other than [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], or _ (underscore).\nNon-string keys such as numbers, booleans, and null.\nVariable keys which are described later.\nComposite keys which are described later.\n\nReferences are always prefixed with a variable that identifies the root\ndocument. In the example above this is p. The root document may be:\n\na local variable inside a rule.\na rule inside the same package.\na document stored in OPA.\na documented temporarily provided to OPA as part of a transaction.\n\nVariable Keys\nReferences can include variables as keys. References written this way are used to select a value from every element in a collection.\nThe following reference will select the hostnames of all the servers in our\nexample data:\n> sites[i].servers[j].hostname\n+---+---+------------------------------+\n| i | j | sites[i].servers[j].hostname |\n+---+---+------------------------------+\n| 0 | 0 | \"hydrogen\"                   |\n| 0 | 1 | \"helium\"                     |\n| 0 | 2 | \"lithium\"                    |\n| 1 | 0 | \"beryllium\"                  |\n| 1 | 1 | \"boron\"                      |\n| 1 | 2 | \"carbon\"                     |\n| 2 | 0 | \"nitrogen\"                   |\n| 2 | 1 | \"oxygen\"                     |\n+---+---+------------------------------+\n\nConceptually, this is the same as the following imperative (Python) code:\ndef hostnames(sites):\n    result = []\n    for site in sites:\n        for server in site.servers:\n            result.append(server.hostname)\n    return result\n\nIn the reference above, we effectively used variables named i and j to iterate the collections. If the variables are unused outside the reference, we prefer to replace them with an underscore (_) character. The reference above can be rewritten as:\n> sites[_].servers[_].hostname\n+------------------------------+\n| sites[_].servers[_].hostname |\n+------------------------------+\n| \"hydrogen\"                   |\n| \"helium\"                     |\n| \"lithium\"                    |\n| \"beryllium\"                  |\n| \"boron\"                      |\n| \"carbon\"                     |\n| \"nitrogen\"                   |\n| \"oxygen\"                     |\n+------------------------------+\n\nThe underscore is special because it cannot be referred to by other parts of the rule, e.g., the other side of the expression, another expression, etc. The underscore can be thought of as a special iterator. Each time an underscore is specified, a new iterator is instantiated.\n\nUnder the hood, OPA translates the _ character to a unique variable name that does not conflict with variables and rules that are in scope.\n\nComposite Keys\nReferences can include Composite Values as keys if the key is being used to refer into a set. Composite keys may not be used in refs\nfor base data documents, they are only valid for references into virtual documents.\nThis is useful for checking for the presence of composite values within a set, or extracting all values within a set matching some pattern.\nFor example:\n> s = {[1, 2], [1, 4], [2, 6]}\n> s[[1, 2]]\n[\n  1,\n  2\n]\n> s[[1, x]]\n+---+\n| x |\n+---+\n| 2 |\n| 4 |\n+---+\n\nMultiple Expressions\nRules are often written in terms of multiple expressions that contain references to documents. In the following example, the rule defines a set of arrays where each array contains an application name and a hostname of a server where the application is deployed.\napps_and_hostnames[[name, hostname]] {\n    apps[i].name = name\n    apps[i].servers[_] = server\n    sites[j].servers[k].name = server\n    sites[j].servers[k].hostname = hostname\n}\n\nThe result:\n> apps_and_hostnames[x]\n+----------------------+\n|          x           |\n+----------------------+\n| [\"web\",\"hydrogen\"]   |\n| [\"web\",\"helium\"]     |\n| [\"web\",\"beryllium\"]  |\n| [\"web\",\"boron\"]      |\n| [\"web\",\"nitrogen\"]   |\n| [\"mysql\",\"lithium\"]  |\n| [\"mysql\",\"carbon\"]   |\n| [\"mongodb\",\"oxygen\"] |\n+----------------------+\n\nDon’t worry about understanding everything in this example right now. There are just two important points:\n\nSeveral variables appear more than once in the body. When a variable is used in multiple locations, OPA will only produce documents for the rule with the variable bound to the same value in all expressions.\nThe rule is joining the apps and sites documents implicitly. In Rego (and other languages based on Datalog), joins are implicit.\n\nSelf-Joins\nUsing a different key on the same array or object provides the equivalent of self-join in SQL. For example, the following rule defines a document containing apps deployed on the same site as \"mysql\":\nsame_site[apps[k].name] {\n    apps[i].name = \"mysql\"\n    apps[i].servers[_] = server\n    sites[j].servers[_].name = server\n    sites[j].servers[_].name = other_server\n    server != other_server\n    apps[k].servers[_] = other_server\n}\n\nThe result:\n> same_site[x]\n+-------+\n|   x   |\n+-------+\n| \"web\" |\n| \"web\" |\n| \"web\" |\n| \"web\" |\n+-------+\n\nComprehensions\nComprehensions provide a concise way of building Composite Values from sub-queries.\nLike Rules, comprehensions consist of a head and a body. The body of a comprehension can be understood in exactly the same way as the body of a rule, that is, one or more expressions that must all be true in order for the overall body to be true. When the body evaluates to true, the head of the comprehension is evaluated to produce an element in the result.\nThe body of a comprehension is able to refer to variables defined in the outer body. For example:\n> region = \"west\"; names = [name | sites[i].region = region; sites[i].name = name]\n+-----------------+--------+\n|      names      | region |\n+-----------------+--------+\n| [\"smoke\",\"dev\"] | \"west\" |\n+-----------------+--------+\n\nIn the above query, the second expression contains an Array Comprehension that refers to the region variable. The region variable will be bound in the outer body.\n\nWhen a comprehension refers to a variable in an outer body, OPA will reorder expressions in the outer body so that variables referred to in the comprehension are bound by the time the comprehension is evaluated.\n\nComprehensions are similar to the same constructs found in other languages like Python. For example, we could write the above comprehension in Python as follows:\n# Python equivalent of Rego comprehension shown above.\nnames = [site.name for site in sites if site.region == \"west\"]\n\nComprehensions are often used to group elements by some key. A common use case for comprehensions is to assist in computing aggregate values (e.g., the number of containers running on a host).\nArray Comprehensions\nArray Comprehensions build array values out of sub-queries. Array Comprehensions have the form:\n[  |  ]\n\nFor example, the following rule defines an object where the keys are application names and the values are hostnames of servers where the application is deployed. The hostnames of servers are represented as an array.\napp_to_hostnames[app_name] = hostnames {\n    apps[_] = app\n    app_name = app.name\n    hostnames = [hostname | name = app.servers[_]\n                            sites[_].servers[_] = s\n                            s.name = name\n                            hostname = s.hostname]\n}\n\nThe result:\n> app_to_hostnames[app] = hostnames\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n|    app    |                      hostnames                       |\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n| \"web\"     | [\"hydrogen\",\"helium\",\"beryllium\",\"boron\",\"nitrogen\"] |\n| \"mysql\"   | [\"lithium\",\"carbon\"]                                 |\n| \"mongodb\" | [\"oxygen\"]                                           |\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n\nObject Comprehensions\nObject Comprehensions build object values out of sub-queries. Object Comprehensions have the form:\n{ :  |  }\n\nWe can use Object Comprehensions to write the rule from above as a comprehension instead:\napp_to_hostnames = {app.name: hostnames |\n    apps[_] = app\n    hostnames = [hostname |\n                    name = app.servers[_]\n                    sites[_].servers[_] = s\n                    s.name = name\n                    hostname = s.hostname]\n}\n\nThe result is the same:\n> app_to_hostnames[app]\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n|    app    |                app_to_hostnames[app]                 |\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n| \"web\"     | [\"hydrogen\",\"helium\",\"beryllium\",\"boron\",\"nitrogen\"] |\n| \"mysql\"   | [\"lithium\",\"carbon\"]                                 |\n| \"mongodb\" | [\"oxygen\"]                                           |\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n\nObject comprehensions are not allowed to have conflicting entries, similar to rules:\n> {\"foo\": y | y = z[_]; z = [1, 2, 3]}\n{\"foo\": y | y = z[_]; z = [1, 2, 3]}: eval_conflict_error: object comprehension produces conflicting outputs\n\nSet Comprehensions\nSet Comprehensions build set values out of sub-queries. Set Comprehensions have the form:\n{  |  }\n\nFor example, to construct a set from an array:\n> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5]\n> b = {x | x = a[_]}\n> b\n[\n  1,\n  2,\n  3,\n  4,\n  5\n]\n\nRules\nRules define the content of Virtual Documents in\nOPA. When OPA evaluates a rule, we say OPA generates the content of the\ndocument that is defined by the rule.\nThe sample code in this section make use of the data defined in Examples.\nGenerating Sets\nThe following rule defines a set containing the hostnames of all servers:\nhostnames[name] { sites[_].servers[_].hostname = name }\n\nWhen we query for the content of hostnames we see the same data as we would if we queried using the sites[_].servers[_].hostname reference directly:\n> hostnames[name]\n+-------------+\n|    name     |\n+-------------+\n| \"hydrogen\"  |\n| \"helium\"    |\n| \"lithium\"   |\n| \"beryllium\" |\n| \"boron\"     |\n| \"carbon\"    |\n| \"nitrogen\"  |\n| \"oxygen\"    |\n+-------------+\n\nThis example introduces a few important aspects of Rego.\nFirst, the rule defines a set document where the contents are defined by the variable name. We know this rule defines a set document because the head only includes a key. All rules have the following form (where key, value, and body are all optional):\n ? ? ?\nFor a more formal definition of the rule syntax, see the Language Reference document.\nSecond, the sites[_].servers[_].hostname fragment selects the hostname attribute from all of the objects in the servers collection. From reading the fragment in isolation we cannot tell whether the fragment refers to arrays or objects. We only know that it refers to a collections of values.\nThird, the sites[_].servers[_].hostname = name expression binds the value of the hostname attribute to the variable name, which is also declared in the head of the rule.\nGenerating Objects\nRules that define objects are very similar to rules that define sets.\napps_by_hostname[hostname] = app {\n    sites[_].servers[_] = server\n    server.hostname = hostname\n    apps[i].servers[_] = server.name\n    apps[i].name = app\n}\n\nThe rule above defines an object that maps hostnames to app names. The main difference between this rule and one which defines a set is the rule head: in addition to declaring a key, the rule head also declares a value for the document.\nThe result:\n> apps_by_hostname[\"helium\"] = app\n+-------+\n|  app  |\n+-------+\n| \"web\" |\n+-------+\nIncremental Definitions\nA rule may be defined multiple times with the same name. When a rule is defined\nthis way, we refer to the rule definition as incremental because each\ndefinition is additive. The document produced by incrementally defined rules is\nthe union of the documents produced by each individual rule.\nFor example, we can write a rule that abstracts over our servers and\ncontainers data as instances:\ninstances[instance] {\n    sites[_].servers[_] = server\n    instance = {\"address\": server.hostname, \"name\": server.name}\n}\n\ninstances[instance] {\n    containers[_] = container\n    instance = {\"address\": container.ipaddress, \"name\": container.name}\n}\n\nIf the head of the rule is same, we can chain multiple rule bodies together to\nobtain the same result:\ninstances[instance] {\n    sites[_].servers[_] = server\n    instance = {\"address\": server.hostname, \"name\": server.name}\n} {\n    containers[_] = container\n    instance = {\"address\": container.ipaddress, \"name\": container.name}\n}\n\nAn incrementally defined rule can be intuitively understood as  OR  OR ... OR .\nThe result:\n> instances[x]\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n|                       x                       |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n| {\"address\":\"hydrogen\",\"name\":\"web-0\"}         |\n| {\"address\":\"helium\",\"name\":\"web-1\"}           |\n| {\"address\":\"lithium\",\"name\":\"db-0\"}           |\n| {\"address\":\"beryllium\",\"name\":\"web-1000\"}     |\n| {\"address\":\"boron\",\"name\":\"web-1001\"}         |\n| {\"address\":\"carbon\",\"name\":\"db-1000\"}         |\n| {\"address\":\"nitrogen\",\"name\":\"web-dev\"}       |\n| {\"address\":\"oxygen\",\"name\":\"db-dev\"}          |\n| {\"address\":\"10.0.0.1\",\"name\":\"big_stallman\"}  |\n| {\"address\":\"10.0.0.2\",\"name\":\"cranky_euclid\"} |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n\nComplete Definitions\nIn addition to rules that partially define sets and objects, Rego also\nsupports so-called complete definitions of any type of document. Rules provide\na complete definition by omitting the key in the head. Complete definitions are\ncommonly used for constants:\npi = 3.14159\n\n\nRego allows authors to omit the body of rules. If the body is omitted, it\ndefaults to true.\n\nDocuments produced by rules with complete definitions can only have one value at\na time. If evaluation produces multiple values for the same document, an error\nwill be returned.\nFor example:\n# Define user \"bob\" for test input.\nuser = \"bob\"\n\n# Define two sets of users: power users and restricted users. Accidentally\n# include \"bob\" in both.\npower_users = {\"alice\", \"bob\", \"fred\"}\nrestricted_users = {\"bob\", \"kim\"}\n\n# Power users get 32GB memory.\nmax_memory = 32 { power_users[user] }\n\n# Restricted users get 4GB memory.\nmax_memory = 4 { restricted_users[user] }\n\nError:\n> max_memory\nmax_memory: eval_conflict_error: completely defined rules must produce exactly one value\nOPA returns an error in this case because the rule definitions are in conflict. The value produced by max_memory cannot be 32 and 4 at the same time.\nThe documents produced by rules with complete definitions may still be undefined:\n> unset user\n> user = \"johnson\"  # user is not in either of the sets defined earlier.\n> max_memory\nundefined\n\nIn some cases, having an undefined result for a document is not desirable. In those cases, policies can use the Default Keyword to provide a fallback value.\nFunctions\nRego supports user-defined functions that can be called with the same semantics as Built-in Functions. They have access to both the the data Document and the input Document.\nFor example, the following function will return the result of trimming the spaces from a string and then splitting it by periods.\n> trim_and_split(s) = x {\n|     trim(s, \" \", t)\n|     split(t, \".\", x)\n| }\n|\n> trim_and_split(\"   foo.bar \", out)\n+---------------+\n|      out      |\n+---------------+\n| [\"foo\",\"bar\"] |\n+---------------+\n\nFunctions may have an arbitrary number of inputs, but exactly one output. Function arguments may be any kind of term. For example, suppose we have the following function:\nfoo([x, {\"bar\": y}]) = z {\n    z = {x: y}\n}\nThe following calls would produce the logical mappings given:\n\n\n\nCall\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\nfoo(a, z)\na[0]\na[1].bar\n\n\nfoo([\"5\", {\"bar\": \"hello\"}], z)\n\"5\"\n\"hello\"\n\n\nfoo([\"5\", {\"bar\": [1, 2, 3, [\"foo\", \"bar\"]]}], z)\n\"5\"\n[1, 2, 3, [\"foo\", \"bar\"]]\n\n\n\nIf you need multiple outputs, write your functions so that the output is an array, object or set containing your results. If the output term is omitted, it is equivalent to having the output term be the literal true. That is, the function declarations below are equivalent:\nf(x) {\n    x = \"foo\"\n}\n\nf(x) = true {\n    x = \"foo\"\n}\nThe outputs of user functions have some additional limitations, namely that they must resolve to a single value. If you write a function that has multiple possible bindings for an output variable, you will get a conflict error:\n> p(x) = y {\n|     x[_] = y\n| }\n|\n> p([1, 2, 3], out)\np([1, 2, 3], out): eval_conflict_error: completely defined rules must produce exactly one value\n\nIt is possible in Rego to define a function more than once, to achieve a conditional selection of which function to execute:\nFunctions can be defined incrementally.\n> p(1, x) = y {\n|     y = x\n| }\n|\n> p(2, x) = y {\n|     y = x*4\n| }\n|\n> p(1, 2, y)\n+---+\n| y |\n+---+\n| 2 |\n+---+\n> p(2, 2, y)\n+---+\n| y |\n+---+\n| 8 |\n+---+\n\nA given function call will execute all functions that match the signature given. If a call matches multiple functions, they must produce the same output, or else a conflict error will occur:\n> p(1, x) = y {\n|     y = x\n| }\n|\n> p(x, 2) = y {\n|     y = x*4\n| }\n|\n> p(1, 2, y)\np(1, 2, y): eval_conflict_error: completely defined rules must produce exactly one value\n\nOn the other hand, if a call matches no functions, then the result is undefined, and the query containing it will become unsatisfied.\n> p(x, 2) = y {\n|     y = x*4\n| }\n|\n> p(5, 2, y)\n+----+\n| y  |\n+----+\n| 20 |\n+----+\n> p(5, 3, y)\nfalse\nNegation\nTo generate the content of a Virtual Document, OPA attempts to bind variables in the body of the rule such that all expressions in the rule evaluate to True.\nThis generates the correct result when the expressions represent assertions about what states should exist in the data stored in OPA. In some cases, you want to express that certain states should not exist in the data stored in OPA. In these cases, negation must be used.\nFor safety, a variable appearing in a negated expression must also appear in another non-negated equality expression in the rule.\n\nOPA will reorder expressions to ensure that negated expressions are evaluated after other non-negated expressions with the same variables. OPA will reject rules containing negated expressions that do not meet the safety criteria described above.\n\nThe simplest use of negation involves only scalar values or variables and is equivalent to complementing the operator:\nt {\n    greeting = \"hello\"\n    not greeting = \"goodbye\"\n}\n\nThe result:\n> t\ntrue\n\nNegation is required to check whether some value does not exist in a collection. That is, complementing the operator in an expression such as p[_] = \"foo\" yields p[_] != \"foo\". However, this is not equivalent to not p[\"foo\"].\nFor example, we can write a rule that defines a document containing names of apps not deployed on the \"prod\" site:\nprod_servers[name] {\n    sites[_] = site\n    site.name = \"prod\"\n    site.servers[_].name = name\n}\n\napps_in_prod[name] {\n    apps[_] = app\n    app.servers[_] = server\n    app.name = name\n    prod_servers[server]\n}\n\napps_not_in_prod[name] {\n    apps[_].name = name\n    not apps_in_prod[name]\n}\n\nThe result:\n> apps_not_in_prod[name]\n+-----------+\n|   name    |\n+-----------+\n| \"mongodb\" |\n+-----------+\n\nModules\nIn Rego, policies are defined inside modules. Modules consist of:\n\nExactly one Package declaration.\nZero or more Import statements.\nZero or more Rule definitions.\n\nModules are typically represented in Unicode text and encoded in UTF-8.\nComments\nComments begin with the # character and continue until the end of the line.\nPackages\nPackages group the rules defined in one or more modules into a particular namespace. Because rules are namespaced they can be safely shared across projects.\nModules contributing to the same package do not have to be located in the same directory.\nThe rules defined in a module are automatically exported. That is, they can be queried under OPA’s Data API provided the appropriate package is given. For example, given the following module:\npackage opa.examples\n\npi = 3.14159\n\nThe pi document can be queried via the Data API:\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/opa/examples/pi HTTP/1.1\n\nImports\nImport statements declare dependencies that modules have on documents defined outside the package. By importing a document, the identifiers exported by that document can be referenced within the current module.\nAll modules contain implicit statements which import the data and input documents.\nModules use the same syntax to declare dependencies on Base Documents and Virtual Documents.\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport data.servers\n\nhttp_servers[server] {\n    server = servers[_]\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n}\n\nSimilarly, modules can declare dependencies on query arguments by specifying an import path that starts with input.\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport input.user\nimport input.method\n\n# allow alice to perform any operation.\nallow { user = \"alice\" }\n\n# allow bob to perform read-only operations.\nallow {\n    user = \"bob\"\n    method = \"GET\"\n}\n\nImports can include an optional as keyword to handle namespacing issues:\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport data.servers as my_servers\n\nhttp_servers[server] {\n    server = my_servers[_]\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n}\n\nWith Keyword\nThe with keyword allows queries to programmatically specify values nested\nunder The input Document.\nFor example, given the simple authorization policy in the Imports\nsection, we can write a query that checks whether a particular request would be\nallowed:\n> import data.opa.examples.allow\n> allow with input as {\"user\": \"alice\", \"method\": \"POST\"}\ntrue\n> allow with input as {\"user\": \"bob\", \"method\": \"GET\"}\ntrue\n> not allow with input as {\"user\": \"bob\", \"method\": \"DELETE\"}\ntrue\n\nThe with keyword acts as a modifier on expressions. A single expression is\nallowed to have zero or more with modifiers. The with keyword has the\nfollowing syntax:\n with  as  [with  as  [...]]\nThe s must be references to values in the input document (or the input\ndocument itself). The s may be Scalar Values, Variables, or Composite\nValues that do not contain References or Comprehensions.\nDefault Keyword\nThe default keyword allows policies to define a default value for documents\nproduced by rules with Complete Definitions. The\ndefault value is used when all of the rules sharing the same name are undefined.\nFor example:\ndefault allow = false\n\nallow {\n    input.user = \"bob\"\n    input.method = \"GET\"\n}\n\nallow {\n    input.user = \"alice\"\n}\n\nWhen the allow document is queried, the return value will be either true or false.\n> allow with input.user as \"bob\" with input.method as \"POST\"\nfalse\n\nWithout the default definition, the allow document would simply be undefined for the same input.\nWhen the default keyword is used, the rule syntax is restricted to:\ndefault  = \nThe term may be any scalar, composite, or comprehension value but it may not be\na variable or reference. If the value is a composite then it may not contain\nvariables or references.\nElse Keyword\nThe else  keyword is a basic control flow construct that gives you control\nover rule evaluation order.\nRules grouped together with the else keyword are evaluated until a match is\nfound. Once a match is found, rule evaluation does not proceed to rules further\nin the chain.\nThe else keyword is useful if you are porting policies into Rego from an\norder-sensitive system like IPTables.\nauthorize = \"allow\" {\n    input.user = \"superuser\"           # allow 'superuser' to perform any operation.\n} else = \"deny\" {\n    input.path[0] = \"admin\"            # disallow 'admin' operations...\n    input.source_network = \"external\"  # from external networks.\n} # ... more rules\n\nIn the example below, evaluation stops immediately after the first rule even\nthough the input matches the second rule as well.\n> input\n{\n  \"path\": [\n    \"admin\",\n    \"exec_shell\"\n  ],\n  \"source_network\": \"external\",\n  \"user\": \"superuser\"\n}\n> authorize\n\"allow\"\n\nIn the next example, the input matches the second rule (but not the first) so\nevaluation continues to the second rule before stopping.\n> input\n{\n  \"path\": [\n    \"admin\",\n    \"exec_shell\"\n  ],\n  \"source_network\": \"external\",\n  \"user\": \"alice\"\n}\n> authorize\n\"deny\"\n\nThe else keyword may be used repeatedly on the same rule and there is no\nlimit imposed on the number of else clauses on a rule.\nOperators\nEquality\nThe equality operator (=) is used to define expressions that assert that\ntwo values are the same. If the expression is defined in terms of one or more\nvariables then the expression will evaluate to true if one of the variables\nis unbound. If the neither operand is an unbound variable, the expression is\nevaluated by comparing the values referenced by the operands.\nOPA attempts to bind variables to values when it encounters unbound\nvariables in equality expressions. Binding a variable affects subsequent\nevaluation of expressions such that the variable will be treated as a\nconstant (with the bound value) instead of a variable.\nAssignment\nThe assignment operator (:=) is used to define local variables. Unlike\nequality (=), assigned variables are locally scoped and shadow global\nsymbols.\npackage example\n\nx = 100\n\np {\n    x := 1     # declare local variable 'x'\n    x != 100   # true because 'x' refers to local variable\n}\n\nAssigned variables are not allowed to appear before the assignment in the\nquery. For example, the following policy will not compile:\npackage example\n\np {\n    x != 100\n    x := 1     # error because x appears earlier in the query.\n}\n\nq {\n    x := 1\n    x := 2     # error because x is assigned twice.\n}\n\nComparison\nThe following comparison operators are supported:\na  ==  b  #  `a` is equal to `b`.\na  !=  b  #  `a` is not equal to `b`.\na     b  #  `a` is greater than `b`.\na  >=  b  #  `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.\n\nUnlike the equality operator, these operators do not bind variables contained\nin the expression. As a result, if either operand is a variable, the variable\nmust appear in another expression in the same rule that would cause the\nvariable to be bound, i.e., an equality expression or the target position of\na built-in function.\nBuilt-in Functions\nIn some cases, rules must perform simple arithmetic, aggregation, and so on.\nRego provides a number of built-in functions (or “built-ins”) for performing\nthese tasks.\nBuilt-ins can be easily recognized by their syntax. All built-ins have the\nfollowing form:\n(, , ..., )\nBuilt-ins usually take one or more input values and produce at least one output\nvalue. Unless stated otherwise, all built-ins accept values or variables as\noutput arguments.\nBuilt-ins can include \".\" characters in the name. This allows them to be\nnamespaced. If you are adding custom built-ins to OPA, consider namespacing\nthem to avoid naming conflicts, e.g., org.example.special_func.\nSee the Language Reference document for\ndetails on each built-in function.\nExample Data\nThe rules below define the content of documents describing a simplistic deployment environment.

In this\ncase, the response will not contain a result property.\nGet a Document (Webhook)\nPOST /v0/data/{path:.+}\nContent-Type: application/json\nGet a document from a webhook.\nUse this API if you are enforcing policy decisions via webhooks that have pre-defined\nrequest/response formats. Note, the API path prefix is /v0 instead of /v1.\nThe request message body defines the content of the The input\nDocument. The request message body\nmay be empty. The path separator is used to access values inside object and\narray documents.\nThe examples below assume the following policy:\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport input.example.flag\n\nallow_request { flag = true }\n\nExample Request\nPOST /v0/data/opa/examples/allow_request HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"example\": {\n    \"flag\": true\n  }\n}\n\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\ntrue\n\nQuery Parameters\n\npretty - If parameter is true, response will formatted for humans.\n\nStatus Codes\n\n200 - no error\n400 - bad request\n404 - not found\n500 - server error\n\nIf the requested document is missing or undefined, the server will return 404 and the message body will contain an error object.\nCreate or Overwrite a Document\nPUT /v1/data/{path:.+}\nContent-Type: application/json\nCreate or overwrite a document.\nIf the path does not refer to an existing document, the server will attempt to create all of the necessary containing documents. This behavior is similar in principle to the Unix command mkdir -p.\nThe server will respect the If-None-Match header if it is set to *. In this case, the server will not overwrite an existing document located at the path.\nExample Request To Initialize Document With If-None-Match\nPUT /v1/data/us-west/servers HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\nIf-None-Match: *\n\n{}\n\nExample Response If Document Already Exists\nHTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\n\nExample Response If Document Does Not Exist\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\nStatus Codes\n\n204 - no content (success)\n304 - not modified\n404 - write conflict\n\nIf the path refers to a virtual document or a conflicting base document the server will respond with 404. A base document conflict will occur if the parent portion of the path refers to a non-object document.\nPatch a Document\nPATCH /v1/data/{path:.+}\nContent-Type: application/json-patch+json\nUpdate a document.\nThe path separator is used to access values inside object and array documents. If the path indexes into an array, the server will attempt to convert the array index to an integer. If the path element cannot be converted to an integer, the server will respond with 404.\nThe server accepts updates encoded as JSON Patch operations. The message body of the request should contain a JSON encoded array containing one or more JSON Patch operations. Each operation specifies the operation type, path, and an optional value. For more information on JSON Patch, see RFC 6902.\nExample Request\nPATCH /v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json-patch+json\n\n[\n    {\"op\": \"add\",\n     \"path\": \"-\",\n     \"value\": {\n         \"id\": \"s5\",\n         \"name\": \"job\",\n         \"protocols\": [\"amqp\"],\n         \"ports\": [\"p3\"]\n     }}\n]\n\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\nStatus Codes\n\n204 - no content (success)\n404 - not found\n500 - server error\n\nThe effective path of the JSON Patch operation is obtained by joining the path portion of the URL with the path value from the operation(s) contained in the message body. In all cases, the parent of the effective path MUST refer to an existing document, otherwise the server returns 404. In the case of remove and replace operations, the effective path MUST refer to an existing document, otherwise the server returns 404.\nDelete a Document\nDELETE /v1/data/{path:.+}\nDelete a document.\nThe server processes the DELETE method as if the client had sent a PATCH request containing a single remove operation.\nExample Request\nDELETE /v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\n\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\nStatus Codes\n\n204 - no content (success)\n404 - not found\n500 - server error\n\nIf the path refers to a non-existent document, the server returns 404.\nQuery API\nExecute a Simple Query\nPOST /\nContent-Type: application/json\nExecute a simple query.\nOPA serves POST requests without a URL path by querying for the document at\npath /data/system/main. The content of that document defines the response\nentirely. The policy example below shows how to define a rule that will produce a\nvalue for the /data/system/main document.\nThe request message body is mapped to the Input Document.\nPUT /v1/policies/example1 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\npackage system\n\nmain = msg {\n  sprintf(\"hello, %v\", input.user, msg)\n}\n\nExample Request\nPOST /\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"user\": [\"alice\"]\n}\n\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n\"hello, alice\"\n\nQuery Parameters\n\npretty - If parameter is true, response will formatted for humans.\n\nStatus Codes\n\n200 - no error\n400 - bad request\n404 - not found\n500 - server error\n\nIf the /data/system/main document is undefined (e.g., because the administrator has not defined one) the server returns 404.\nExecute an Ad-hoc Query\nGET /v1/query\nExecute an ad-hoc query and return bindings for variables found in the query.\nExample Request\nGET /v1/query?q=data.servers[i].ports[_] = \"p2\"; data.servers[i].name = name HTTP/1.1\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"i\": 3,\n      \"name\": \"dev\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"i\": 0,\n      \"name\": \"app\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nQuery Parameters\n\nq - The ad-hoc query to execute. OPA will parse, compile, and execute the query represented by the parameter value. The value MUST be URL encoded.\npretty - If parameter is true, response will formatted for humans.\nexplain - Return query explanation in addition to result. Values: full.\nmetrics - Return query performance metrics in addition to result. See Performance Metrics for more detail.\nwatch - Set a watch on the query if the parameter is present. See Watches for more detail.\n\nStatus Codes\n\n200 - no error\n400 - bad request\n404 - watch ID not found\n500 - server error\n501 - streaming not implemented\n\nAuthentication\nThe API is secured via HTTPS, Authentication, and\nAuthorization.\nBearer Tokens\nWhen OPA is started with the --authentication=token command line flag,\nclients MUST provide a Bearer token in the HTTP Authorization header:\nGET /v1/data/exempli-gratia HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer my-secret-token\n\nBearer tokens must be represented with a valid HTTP header value character\nsequence.\nOPA will extract the Bearer token value (which is set to my-secret-token\nabove) and provide it to the authorization component inside OPA that will (i)\nvalidate the token and (ii) execute the authorization policy configured by the\nadmin.\nErrors\nAll of the API endpoints use standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or\nfailure of an API call. If an API call fails, the response will contain a JSON\nencoded object that provides more detail. The errors and location fields are\noptional:\n{\n  \"code\": \"invalid_parameter\",\n  \"message\": \"error(s) occurred while compiling module(s)\",\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"code\": \"rego_unsafe_var_error\",\n      \"message\": \"var x is unsafe\",\n      \"location\": {\n        \"file\": \"example\",\n        \"row\": 3,\n        \"col\": 1\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nExplanations\nOPA supports query explanations that describe (in detail) the steps taken to\nproduce query results.\nExplanations can be requested for:\n\nData API GET queries\nQuery API queries\n\nExplanations are requested by setting the explain query parameter to one of\nthe following values:\n\nfull - returns a full query trace containing every step in the query evaluation process.\n\nBy default, explanations are represented in a machine-friendly format. Set the\npretty parameter to request a human-friendly format for debugging purposes.\nTrace Events\nWhen the explain query parameter is set to full , the response contains an array of Trace Event objects.\nTrace Event objects contain the following fields:\n\nop - identifies the kind of Trace Event. Values: \"Enter\", \"Exit\", \"Eval\", \"Fail\", \"Redo\".\nquery_id - uniquely identifies the query that the Trace Event was emitted for.\nparent_id - identifies the parent query.\ntype - indicates the type of the node field. Values: \"expr\", \"rule\", \"body\".\nnode - contains the AST element associated with the evaluation step.\nlocals - contains the term bindings from the query at the time when the Trace Event was emitted.\n\nQuery IDs\nQueries often reference rules or contain comprehensions. In both cases, query\nevaluation involves evaluation of one or more other queries, e.g., the body of\nthe rule or comprehension.\nTrace Events from different queries can be distinguished by the query_id\nfield.\nTrace Events from related queries can be identified by the parent_id field.\nFor example, if query A references a rule R, Trace Events emitted as part of\nevaluating rule R's body will have the parent_id field set to query A's\nquery_id.\nTypes of Events\nEach Trace Event represents a step in the query evaluation process. Trace Events\nare emitted at the following points:\n\nenter - before a body or rule is evaluated.\nexit - after a body or rule has evaluated successfully.\neval - before an expression is evaluated.\nfail - after an expression has evaluated to false.\nredo - before evaluation restarts from a body, rule, or expression.\n\nBy default, OPA searches for all sets of term bindings that make all expressions\nin the query evaluate to true. Because there may be multiple answers, the search\ncan restart when OPA determines the query is true or false. When the search\nrestarts, a Redo Trace Event is emitted.\nExample Trace Event\n{\n  \"op\": \"eval\",\n  \"query_id\": 20,\n  \"parent_id\": 0,\n  \"type\": \"expr\",\n  \"node\": {\n    \"index\": 1,\n    \"terms\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"eq\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"x\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"y\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"locals\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"x\"\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"value\": \"hello\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPerformance Metrics\nOPA can report detailed performance metrics at runtime. Performance metrics can\nbe requested on individual API calls and are returned inline with the API\nresponse. To enable performance metric collection on an API call, specify the\nmetrics=true query parameter when executing the API call. Performance metrics\nare currently supported for the following APIs:\n\nData API (GET and POST)\nPolicy API (all methods)\nQuery API (all methods)\n\nFor example:\nPOST /v1/data/example?metrics=true HTTP/1.1\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"timer_rego_query_compile_ns\": 69994,\n    \"timer_rego_query_eval_ns\": 48425,\n    \"timer_rego_query_parse_ns\": 4096\n  },\n  \"result\": {\n    \"some_strings\": [\n      \"hello\",\n      \"world\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nOPA currently supports the following query performance metrics:\n\ntimer_rego_query_parse_ns: time taken (in nanonseconds) to parse the query.\ntimer_rego_query_compile_ns: time taken (in nanonseconds) to compile the query.\ntimer_rego_query_eval_ns: time taken (in nanonseconds) to evaluate the query.\ntimer_rego_module_parse_ns: time taken (in nanoseconds) to parse the input policy module.\ntimer_rego_module_compile_ns: time taken (in nanoseconds) to compile the loaded policy modules.\n\nOPA also supports query instrumentation. To enable query instrumentation,\nspecify the instrument=true query parameter when executing the API call.\nQuery instrumentation can help diagnose performance problems, however, it can\nadd significant overhead to query evaluation. We recommend leaving query\ninstrumentation off unless you are debugging a performance problem.\nWatches\nOPA can set watches on queries and report whenever the result of evaluating the query has changed. When a watch is set on a query, the requesting connection will be maintained as the query results are streamed back in HTTP Chunked Encoding format. A notification reflecting a certain change to the query results will be delivered at most once. That is, if a watch is set on data.x, and then multiple writes are made to data.x, say 1, 2 and 3, only the notification reflecting data.x=3 is always seen eventually (assuming the watch is not ended, there are no connection problems, etc). The notifications reflecting data.x=1 and data.x=2 might be seen. However, the notifications sent are guaranteed to be in order (data.x=2 will always come after data.x=1, if it comes).\nThe notification stream will not be delimited by any value; the client is expected to be able to parse JSON values from the stream one by one, recognizing where one ends and the next begins.\nThe notification stream is a stream of JSON objects, each of which has the following structure:\n{\n    \"result\": ,\n    \"error\": ,\n    \"metrics\": ,\n    \"explanation\": ,\n}\nThe error field is optional; it is omitted when no errors occur. If it is present, it is an Error describing any errors encountered while evaluating the query the watch was set on. If the policies on the server are changed such that the query no longer compiles, the contents of the error's message field will start with the text \"watch invalidated:\" and will be followed with the reason for invalidation. The watch will be ended by the server and the stream closed.\nThe metrics field represents Performance Metrics for the evaluation of the query. It will only be present if metrics were requested in the API call that started the watch.\nThe explanation field represents an Explanation of how the query answer was found. It will only be present if explanations were requested in the API call that started the watch.\nIf there are no errors, the result field will be a JSON array of the results of evaluating the query. The format of a result is:\n{\n    \"expressions\": [\n        {\n            \"value\": true,\n            \"text\": \"a = data.x\",\n            \"location\":{\"row\":1,\"col\":1}\n        },\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"bindings\": {...}\n}\nThe expressions field is an array of the results of evaluating each of the expressions in the query. value is the expression's value, text is the actual expression, and location describes the location of the expression within the query. The values above are examples.\nThe bindings field is a JSON object mapping strings to JSON values that describe the variable bindings resulting from evaluating the query.\nIf the watch was set on a data reference instead of a query, the result field will simply be the value of the document requested, instead of an array of values.\n"},"deployments.html":{"url":"deployments.html","title":"Deployments","keywords":"","body":"Deployments\nThis document helps you get OPA up and running in different deployment\nenvironments. You should read this document if you are planning to deploy OPA.\nDocker\nDocker makes OPA easy to deploy in different types of environments.\nThis section explains how to use the official OPA Docker images. If this is your\nfirst time deploying OPA and you plan to use one of the Docker images, we\nrecommend you review this section to familiarize yourself with the basics.\nOPA releases are available as images on Docker Hub.\n\nopenpolicyagent/opa:0.8.0\n\nRunning with Docker\nIf you start OPA outside of Docker without any arguments, it prints a list of\navailable commands. By default, the official OPA Docker image executes the run\ncommand which starts an instance of OPA as an interactive shell. This is nice\nfor development, however, for deployments, we want to run OPA as a server.\nThe run command accepts a --server (or -s) flag that starts OPA as a\nserver. See --help for more information on other arguments. The most important\ncommand line arguments for OPA's server mode are:\n\n--addr to set the listening address (default: 0.0.0.0:8181).\n--log-level (or -l) to set the log level (default: \"info\").\n--log-format to set the log format (default: \"text\").\n\nBy default, OPA listens for normal HTTP connections on 0.0.0.0:8181. To make\nOPA listen for HTTPS connections, see Security.\nWe can run OPA as a server using Docker:\ndocker run -p 8181:8181 openpolicyagent/opa \\\n    run --server --log-level debug\n\nTest that OPA is available:\ncurl -i localhost:8181/\nLogging\nOPA logs to stderr and the level can be set with --log-level/-l. The default log level is info which causes OPA to log request/response headers.\ntime=\"20.7.13-12T03:03:23Z\" level=info msg=\"First line of log stream.\" addr=\":8181\"\ntime=\"20.7.13-12T03:03:30Z\" level=debug msg=\"Received request.\" client_addr=\"172.17.0.1:60952\" req_body= req_id=1 req_method=GET req_params=map[] req_path=\"/v1/data\"\ntime=\"20.7.13-12T03:03:30Z\" level=debug msg=\"Sent response.\" client_addr=\"172.17.0.1:60952\" req_id=1 req_method=GET req_path=\"/v1/data\" resp_bytes=13 resp_duration=0.402793 resp_status=200\nIf the log level is set to debug the request and response message bodies will be logged.

When running inside Docker, you can\nprovide files via volume mounts.\ndocker run -v $PWD/example:/example openpolicyagent/opa \\\n    run -e 'data.example.greeting' \\\n    /example\n\n$PWD/example/data.json:\n{\n    \"hostOS\": \"$(uname)\"\n}\n\n\n$PWD/example/policy.rego:\npackage example\n\ngreeting = msg {\n    concat(\"\", [\"Hello \", data.example.hostOS, \"!\"], msg)\n}\n\n\n\nMore Information\nFor more information on OPA's command line, see --help:\ndocker run openpolicyagent/opa run --help\nTagging\nThe Docker Hub repository contains tags for every release of OPA. For more\ninformation on each release see the GitHub\nReleases page.\nThe \"latest\" tag refers to the most recent release. The latest tag is convenient\nif you want to quickly try out OPA however for production deployments, we\nrecommend using an explicit version tag.\nDevelopment builds are also available on Docker Hub. For each version the\n{version}-dev tag refers the most recent development build for that version.\nThe version information is contained in the OPA executable itself. You can check\nthe version with the following command:\ndocker run openpolicyagent/opa version\n\nKubernetes\nKicking the Tires\nThis section shows how to quickly deploy OPA on top of Kubernetes to try it out.\n\nThese steps assume Kubernetes is deployed with\nminikube. If you are using a different\nKubernetes provider, the steps should be similar. You may need to use a\ndifferent Service configuration at the end.\n\nFirst, create a ConfigMap containing a test policy. The policy will inspect\n\"pod\" objects provided as input. If the pod is missing a \"customer\" label or the\npod includes containers that refer to images outside the acmecorp registry,\n\"allow\" will be false.\nIn this case, the policy file does not contain sensitive information so it's\nfine to store as a ConfigMap. If the file contained sensitive information, then\nwe recommend you store it as a Secret.\nexample.rego\npackage example\n\nimport input.pod\n\ndefault allow = true\n\nallow = false {\n    not pod.metadata.labels.customer\n}\n\nallow = false {\n    container = pod.spec.containers[_]\n    not re_match(\"^registry.acmecorp.com/.+$\", container.image)\n}\n\nkubectl create configmap example-policy \\\n    --from-file example.rego\n\nNext, create a ReplicationController to deploy OPA. The ConfigMap containing the\npolicy is volume mounted into the container. This allows OPA to load the policy\nfrom the file system.\nrc_opa.yaml\nkind: ReplicationController\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: opa\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    app: opa\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: opa\n    spec:\n      volumes:\n      - name: example-policy\n        configMap:\n          name: example-policy\n      containers:\n      - name: opa\n        image: openpolicyagent/opa\n        ports:\n        - name: http\n          containerPort: 8181\n        args:\n        - \"run\"\n        - \"--server\"\n        - \"/policies/example.rego\"\n        volumeMounts:\n        - readOnly: true\n          mountPath: /policies\n          name: example-policy\n\nkubectl create -f rc_opa.yaml\n\nAt this point OPA is up and running. Create a Service to expose the OPA API so\nthat you can query it:\nsvc_opa.yaml\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: opa\n  labels:\n    app: opa\nspec:\n  type: NodePort\n  selector:\n    app: opa\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      protocol: TCP\n      port: 8181\n      targetPort: 8181\n\n\nkubectl create -f svc_opa.yaml\n\nGet the URL of OPA using minikube:\nOPA_URL=$(minikube service opa --url)\n\nExercise the OPA API. Note that the container below references an image outside\nour hypothetical repository:\nexample_pod.json\n{\n    \"input\": {\n        \"kind\": \"Pod\",\n        \"apiVersion\": \"v1\",\n        \"metadata\": {\n            \"name\": \"opa\",\n            \"labels\": {\n                \"customer\": \"example.org\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"spec\": {\n            \"containers\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"opa\",\n                    \"image\": \"openpolicyagent/opa\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\ncurl $OPA_URL/v1/data -d @example_pod.json\n\n"},"bundles.html":{"url":"bundles.html","title":"Bundles","keywords":"","body":"Bundles\nOPA can periodically download bundles of policy and data from remote HTTP\nservers.

You should read this document if you are deploying OPA as a\nservice.\nSecuring the API involves configuring OPA to use TLS, authentication, and\nauthorization so that:\n\nTraffic between OPA and clients is encrypted.\nClients verify the OPA API endpoint identity.\nOPA verifies client identities.\nClients are only granted access to specific APIs or sections of The data Document.\n\nTLS & HTTPS\nHTTPS is configured by specifying TLS credentials via command line flags at\nstartup:\n\n--tls-cert-file= specifies the path of the file containing the TLS certificate.\n--tls-private-key-file= specifies the path of the file containing the TLS private key.\n\nOPA will exit immediately with a non-zero status code if only one of these flags\nis specified.\nBy default, OPA ignores insecure HTTP connections when TLS is enabled.

Client-side authentication of the OPA API endpoint should be handled\nwith TLS.\nAuthentication and authorization allow OPA to:\n\nVerify client identities.\nControl client access to APIs and data.\n\nBoth are configured via command line flags:\n\n--authentication= specifies the authentication scheme to use.\n--authorization= specifies the authorization scheme to use.\n\nBy default, OPA does not perform authentication or authorization and these flags\ndefault to off.\nFor authentication, OPA supports:\n\nBearer tokens: Bearer tokens are enabled by starting OPA with --authentication=token.\n\nFor authorization, OPA relies on policy written in Rego. Authorization is\nenabled by starting OPA with --authorization=basic.\nWhen the basic authorization scheme is enabled, a minimal authorization policy\nmust be provided on startup. The authorization policy must be structured as follows:\n# The \"system\" namespace is reserved for internal use\n# by OPA. Authorization policy must be defined under\n# system.authz as follows:\npackage system.authz\n\ndefault allow = false  # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {\n  # Logic to authorize request goes here.\n}\n\nWhen OPA receives a request, it executes a query against the document defined\ndata.system.authz.allow. The implementation of the policy may span multiple\npackages however it is recommended that administrators keep the policy under the\nsystem namespace.\nIf the document produced by the allow rule is true, the request is\nprocessed normally. If the document is undefined or not true, the\nrequest is rejected immediately.\nOPA provides the following input document when executing the authorization\npolicy:\n{\n    \"input\": {\n        # Identity established by authentication scheme.\n        # When Bearer tokens are used, the identity is\n        # set to the Bearer token value.\n        \"identity\": ,\n\n        # One of {GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE}.\n        \"method\": ,\n\n        # URL path represented as an array.\n        # For example: /v1/data/exempli-gratia\n        # is represented as [v1, data, exampli-gratia]\n        \"path\": ,\n    }\n}\n\nAt a minimum, the authorization policy should grant access to a special root\nidentity:\npackage system.authz\n\ndefault allow = false          # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {                        # Allow request if...\n    \"secret\" = input.identity  # Identity is the secret root key.\n}\n\nWhen OPA is configured with this minimal authorization policy, requests without\nauthentication are rejected:\nGET /v1/policies HTTP/1.1\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"code\": \"unauthorized\",\n  \"message\": \"request rejected by administrative policy\"\n}\n\nHowever, if Bearer token authentication is enabled and the request includes the\nsecret from above, the request is allowed:\nGET /v1/policies HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer secret\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nWhen Bearer tokens are used for authentication, the policy should at minimum\nvalidate the identity:\npackage system.authz\n\n# Tokens may defined in policy or pushed into OPA as data.\ntokens = {\n    \"my-secret-token-foo\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"admin\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-bar\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-1\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-baz\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-2\", \"service-3\"]\n    }\n}\n\ndefault allow = false          # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {                        # Allow request if...\n    input.identity = \"secret\"  # Identity is the secret root key.\n}\n\nallow {                        # Allow request if...\n    tokens[input.identity]     # Identity exists in \"tokens\".\n}\n\nTo complete this example, the policy could further restrict tokens to specific\ndocuments:\npackage system.authz\n\n# Rights may be defined in policy or pushed into OPA as data.\nrights = {\n    \"admin\": {\n        \"path\": \"*\"\n    },\n    \"service-1\": {\n        \"path\": [\"v1\", \"data\", \"exempli\", \"gratia\"]\n    },\n    \"service-2\": {\n        \"path\": [\"v1\", \"data\", \"par\", \"example\"]\n    }\n}\n\n# Tokens may be defined in policy or pushed into OPA as data.\ntokens = {\n    \"my-secret-token-foo\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"admin\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-bar\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-1\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-baz\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-2\", \"service-3\"]\n    }\n}\n\ndefault allow = false               # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {                             # Allow request if...\n    identity_rights[right]          # Rights for identity exist, and...\n    right.path = \"*\"                # Right.path is '*'.\n} {                                 # Or...\n    identity_rights[right]          # Rights for identity exist, and...\n    right.path = input.path         # Right.path matches input.path.\n}\n\nidentity_rights[right] {            # Right is in the identity_rights set if...\n    token = tokens[input.identity]  # Token exists for identity, and...\n    role = token.roles[_]           # Token has a role, and...\n    right = rights[role]            # Role has rights defined.\n}\n\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions\nHow does OPA do conflict resolution?\nIn Rego (OPA's policy language), you can write statements that both allow and\ndeny a request, such as\npackage foo\nallow { input.name = \"alice\" }\ndeny { input.name = \"alice\" }\nNeither allow nor deny are keywords in Rego so if you want to treat them\nas contradictory, you control which one takes precedence explicitly.  When you ask for\na policy decision from OPA, you specify both the policy name (foo) and the\nvirtual document that names the decision within foo.  Typically in this scenario,\nyou create a virtual document called authz and define it so that allow\noverrides deny or vice versa.  Then when asking for a policy decision, you\nask for foo/authz.\n# deny everything by default\ndefault authz = false\n\n# deny overrides allow\nauthz {\n    allow\n    not deny\n}\nIf instead you want to resolve conflicts using a first-match strategy (where\nthe first statement applicable makes the decision), see the FAQ entry on\nstatement order.\nDoes Statement Order Matter?\nThe order in which statements occur does not matter in Rego.  Reorder any two statements\nand the policy means exactly the same thing.  For example, the following two statements\nmean the same thing whichever order you write them in.\nratelimit = 4 { input.name = \"alice\" }\nratelimit = 5 { input.owner = \"bob\" }\nSometimes, though, you want the statement order to matter.  For example, you might put more specific statements before more general statements so that the more specific statements take precedence (e.g. for conflict resolution).  Rego lets you do that using the else keyword.  For example, if you want to make the first statement above take precedence, you would write the following Rego.\nratelimit = 4 {\n    input.name = \"alice\"\n} else = 5 {\n    input.owner = \"bob\"\n}\n"},"comparison-to-other-systems.html":{"url":"comparison-to-other-systems.html","title":"Comparison to Other Systems","keywords":"","body":"Comparison to Other Systems\nOften the easiest way to understand a new language is by comparing\nit to languages you already know.  Here we show how policies from\nseveral existing policy systems can be implemented with the Open\nPolicy Agent.\nRole-based access control (RBAC)\nRole-based access control (RBAC) is pervasive today for authorization.\nTo use RBAC for authorization, you write down two different kinds of\ninformation.\n\nWhich users have which roles\nWhich roles have which permissions\n\nOnce you provide RBAC with both those assignments, RBAC tells you\nhow to make an authorization decision.  A user is authorized for\nall those permissions assigned to any of the roles she is assigned to.\nFor example, we might have the following user/role assignments:\n\n\n\nUser\nRole\n\n\n\n\nalice\nengineering\n\n\nalice\nwebdev\n\n\nbob\nhr\n\n\n\nAnd the following role/permission assignments:\n\n\n\nRole\nPermission\nResource\n\n\n\n\nengineering\nread\nserver123\n\n\nwebdev\nwrite\nserver123\n\n\nwebdev\nread\nserver123\n\n\nhr\nwrite\ndatabase456\n\n\n\nIn this example, RBAC makes the following authorization decisions:\n\n\n\nUser\nOperation\nResource\nDecision\n\n\n\n\nalice\nread\nserver123\nallow because alice is in engineering\n\n\nalice\nwrite\nserver123\nallow because alice is in webdev\n\n\nbob\nread\ndatabase456\nallow because bob is in hr\n\n\nbob\nread\nserver123\ndeny because bob is not in engineering or webdev\n\n\n\nWith OPA, you can write the following snippets to implement the\nexample RBAC policy shown above.\npackage rbac.authz\n\n# Policy decisions are made using the following input\n#   Not part of the policy but good as documentation\n# input = {\n#     \"user\": \"bob\",\n#     \"action\": \"read\",\n#     \"object\": \"server123\"\n# }\n\n# user-role assignments\nuser_roles = {\n    \"alice\": [\"engineering\", \"webdev\"],\n    \"bob\": [\"hr\"]\n}\n\n# role-permissions assignments\nrole_permissions = {\n    \"engineering\": [{\"action\": \"read\",  \"object\": \"server123\"}],\n    \"webdev\":      [{\"action\": \"read\",  \"object\": \"server123\"},\n                    {\"action\": \"write\", \"object\": \"server123\"}],\n    \"hr\":          [{\"action\": \"read\",  \"object\": \"database456\"}]\n}\n\n# logic that implements RBAC.\ndefault allow = false\nallow {\n    # lookup the list of roles for the user\n    roles = user_roles[input.user]\n    # for each role in that list\n    r = roles[_]\n    # lookup the permissions list for role r\n    permissions = role_permissions[r]\n    # for each permission\n    p = permissions[_]\n    # check if the permission granted to r matches the user's request\n    #    Note: equality (=) works for both assignment and comparison\n    {\"action\": input.action, \"object\": input.object} = p\n}\n\nRBAC Separation of duty (SOD)\nSeparation of duty (SOD) refers to the idea that there are certain\ncombinations of permissions that no one should have at the same time.\nFor example, no one should be able to both create payments and approve payments.\nIn RBAC, that means there are some pairs of roles that no one should be\nassigned simultaneously.  For example, any user assigned both of the roles\nin each pair below would violate SOD.\n\ncreate-payment and approve-payment\ncreate-vendor and pay-vendor\n\nOPA's API does not yet let you enforce SOD by rejecting improper role-assignments,\nbut it does let you express SOD constraints and ask for all SOD violations,\nas shown below.  (Here we assume the statements below are added to the RBAC\nstatements above.)\n# Pairs of roles that no user can be assigned to simultaneously\nsod_roles = [\n    [\"create-payment\", \"approve-payment\"],\n    [\"create-vendor\", \"pay-vendor\"]\n]\n\n# Find all users violating SOD\nsod_violation[user] {\n    # grab one role for a user\n    role1 = user_role[user][_]\n    # grab another role for that same user\n    role2 = user_role[user][_]\n    # check if those roles are forbidden by SOD\n    sod_roles[_] = [role1, role2]\n}\n\n(For those familar with SOD, this is the static version since SOD violations\nhappen whenever a user is assigned two conflicting roles.  The dynamic version of SOD allows\na single user to be assigned two conflicting roles but requires that the same user not\nutilize those roles on the same transaction, which is out of scope for this document.)\nAttribute-based access control (ABAC)\nWith attribute-based access control, you make policy decisions using the\nattributes of the users, objects, and actions involved in the request.\nIt has three main components:\n\nAttributes for users\nAttributes for objects\nLogic dictating which attribute combinations are authorized\n\nFor example, we might know the following attributes for our users\n\nalice\njoined the company 15 years ago\nis a trader\n\n\nbob\njoined the company 5 years ago\nis an analyst\n\n\n\nWe would also have attributes for the objects, in this case stock ticker symbols.\n\nMSFT\nis sold on NASDAQ\nsells at $59.20 per share\n\n\nAMZN\nis sold on NASDAQ\nsells at $813.64 per share\n\n\n\nAn example ABAC policy in english might be:\n\nTraders may purchase NASDAQ stocks for under $2M\nTraders with 10+ years experience may purchase NASDAQ stocks for under $5M\n\nOPA supports ABAC policies as shown below.\npackage abac\n\n# Sample input\n# input = {\n#    \"user\": \"alice\",\n#    \"ticker\": \"MSFT\",\n#    \"action\": \"buy\",\n#    \"amount\": 1000000\n# }\n\n# User attributes\nuser_attributes = {\n    \"alice\": {\"tenure\": 15, \"title\": \"trader\"},\n    \"bob\": {\"tenure\": 5, \"title\": \"analyst\"}\n}\n\n# Stock attributes\nticker_attributes = {\n    \"MSFT\": {\"exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"price\": 59.20},\n    \"AMZN\": {\"exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"price\": 813.64}\n}\n\n# all traders may buy NASDAQ under $2M\nallow {\n    # lookup the user's attributes\n    user = user_attributes[input.user]\n    # check that the user is a trader\n    user.title = \"trader\"\n    # check that the stock being purchased is sold on the NASDAQ\n    tickerAttributes[input.ticker].exchange = \"NASDAQ\"\n    # check that the purchase amount is under $2M\n    input.amount  10\n    # check that the purchase amount is under $5M\n    input.amount \nIn OPA, there's nothing special about users and objects.  You can attach\nattributes to anything.  And the attributes can themselves be structured JSON objects\nand have attributes on attributes on attributes.  Because OPA was designed to work\nwith arbitrarily nested JSON data, it supports incredibly rich ABAC policies.\nAmazon Web Services IAM\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) lets you create policies that you attach to users, roles, groups,\nand resources.  You write allow and deny statements to decide which users can\nexecute which API calls on which resources.  By default all API access is denied;\npolicy statements can explicitly allow API access.  If an API is both allowed and\ndenied, it is always denied.\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"FirstStatement\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\"iam:ChangePassword\"],\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"SecondStatement\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\",\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"ThirdStatement\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:List*\",\n        \"s3:Get*\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data\",\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data/*\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nIn OPA, you write each of the AWS allow statements as a separate statement, and you\nexpect the input to have user, action, and resource fields.\npackage aws\n\n# input = {\n#     \"user\": \"alice\",\n#     \"action\": \"ec2:StartInstance\"\n#     \"resource\": \"arn:aws:ec2:::instance/i78999879\"\n# }\n\n# FirstStatement\nallow {\n    input.action = \"iam:ChangePassword\"\n}\n\n# SecondStatement\nallow {\n    input.action = \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\"\n}\n\n# ThirdStatement\n#  Use helpers to handle implicit OR in the AWS policy.\n#  Below both 'actions_match' and 'resources_match' must be true.\nallow {\n    actions_match\n    resources_match\n}\n\n# actions_match is true if input.action matches one in the list\nactions_match {\n    # iterate over the actions in the list\n    actions = [\"s3:List*\",\"s3:Get*\"]\n    action = actions[_]\n    # check if input.action matches an action\n    regex.globs_match(input.action, action)\n}\n\n# resources_match is true if input.resource matches one in the list\nresources_match {\n    # iterate over the resources in the list\n    resources = [\"arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data\",\"arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data/*\"]\n    resource = resources[_]\n    # check if input.resource matches a resource\n    regex.globs_match(input.resource, resource)\n}\n\nXACML\neXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) was designed to express security policies: allow/deny decisions  using attributes of users, resources, actions, and the environment.\nThe following policy says that users from the organization Curtiss or Packard who are US or GreatBritain nationals and who work on DetailedDesign or Simulation are permitted access to documents about NavigationSystems.\n\n  Policy for Business Authorization category TAA-1.1\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          NavigationSystem\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            Any\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Curtiss\n          Packard\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          US\n          GB\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          DetailedDesign\n          Simulation\n        \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThe same statement is shown below in OPA.

E.g., 1048.\nWhich hosts can this container be deployed on? E.g., [\"host1\", \"host40\", ..., \"host329\"].\nWhat updates must be applied to this resource? E.g., {\"labels\": {\"team\": \"products}}.\n\nThis tutorial shows how to get started with OPA using an interactive shell or REPL (read-eval-print loop).\nGoals\nREPLs are great for learning new languages and running quick experiments. You\ncan use OPA's REPL to experiment with policies and prototype new ones.\nTo introduce the REPL, you will use dummy data and an example policy. In English, the policy can be stated as follows:\n\nServers that open an unencrypted HTTP port must not be connected to a public network.\n\nInside the REPL, you will define rules that codify the policy stated above.\nOnce you finish this tutorial, you will be familiar with:\n\nRunning OPA as an interactive shell/REPL.\nWriting ad-hoc queries in Rego.\n\nPrerequisites\nIf this is your first time using OPA, download the latest executable for your system.\nOn macOS (64-bit):\ncurl -L -o opa https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/download/v0.8.0/opa_darwin_amd64\n\nOn Linux (64-bit):\ncurl -L -o opa https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/download/v0.8.0/opa_linux_amd64\n\n\nWindows users can obtain the OPA executable from GitHub Releases. The steps below are the same for Windows users except the executable name will be different.\n\nSet permissions on the OPA executable:\nchmod 755 ./opa\n\nSteps\n1. Make sure you can run the REPL on your machine.\n./opa run\n\nWithout any data, you can experiment with simple expressions to get the hang of it:\n> true\ntrue\n> 3.14\n3.14\n> [\"hello\", \"world\"]\n[\n  \"hello\",\n  \"world\"\n]\n\nYou can also test simple boolean expressions:\n> true = false\nfalse\n> 3.14 > 3\ntrue\n> \"hello\" != \"goodbye\"\ntrue\n\nMost REPLs let you define variables that you can reference later on. OPA allows you to do something similar. For example, you can define a pi constant as follows:\n> pi = 3.14\n\nOnce \"pi\" is defined, you query for the value and write expressions in terms of it:\n> pi\n3.14\n> pi > 3\ntrue\n\nOne thing to watch out for in the REPL is that = is used both for assigning variables values and for testing the value of variables. For example p = q sometimes assigns p the value of q and sometimes checks if the values of p and q are the same. The REPL decides between assignment and test based on whether p already has a value or not. If p has a value, p = q is a test (returning true or false), and if p has no value p = q is an assignment. To unset a value for a variable, use the unset command. (This ambiguity is only really an issue in the REPL. When writing policy, the duality of = is actually beneficial.)\n> pi = 3\nfalse\n> unset pi\n> pi = 3\n> pi\n3\n\nIn addition to running queries, the REPL also lets you define rules:\n> items = [\"pizza\", \"apples\", \"bread\", \"coffee\"]\n> users = {\"bob\": {\"likes\": [0, 2]}, \"alice\": {\"likes\": [1, 2, 3]}}\n> likes[[name, item]] { index = users[name].likes[_]; item = items[index] }\n\nThe likes rule above defines a set of tuples specifying what each user likes.\n> likes[[\"alice\", item]] # what does alice like?\n+----------+\n|   item   |\n+----------+\n| \"apples\" |\n| \"bread\"  |\n| \"coffee\" |\n+----------+\n> likes[[name, \"bread\"]] # who likes bread?\n+---------+\n|  name   |\n+---------+\n| \"bob\"   |\n| \"alice\" |\n+---------+\nWhen you enter expressions into the OPA REPL, you are effectively running queries. The REPL output shows the values of variables in the expression that make the query true. If there is no set of variables that would make the query true, the REPL prints false. If there are no variables in the query and the query evaluates successfully, then the REPL just prints true.\nQuit out of the REPL by pressing Control-D or typing exit:\n> exit\nExiting\n\n2. Create a data file and a policy module.\nLet's define a bit of JSON data that will be used in the tutorial:\ncat >data.json \nAlso, let's include a rule that defines a set of servers that are attached to public networks:\ncat >example.rego \n3. Run the REPL with the data file and policy module as input.\n./opa run data.json example.rego\n\nYou can now run queries against the various documents:\n> data.servers[_].id\n+--------------------+\n| data.servers[_].id |\n+--------------------+\n| \"s1\"               |\n| \"s2\"               |\n| \"s3\"               |\n| \"s4\"               |\n+--------------------+\n> data.opa.example.public_servers[x]\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                       x                                       |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| {\"id\":\"s1\",\"name\":\"app\",\"ports\":[\"p1\",\"p2\",\"p3\"],\"protocols\":[\"https\",\"ssh\"]} |\n| {\"id\":\"s4\",\"name\":\"dev\",\"ports\":[\"p1\",\"p2\"],\"protocols\":[\"http\"]}             |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nOne powerful thing about Rego and the REPL is that you can run queries using the same syntax that you would use to lookup values.\nFor example if i has value 0 then data.servers[i] returns the first value in the data.servers array:\n> i = 0\n> data.servers[i]\n{\n  \"id\": \"s1\",\n  \"name\": \"app\",\n  \"ports\": [\n      \"p1\",\n      \"p2\",\n      \"p3\"\n  ],\n  \"protocols\": [\n      \"https\",\n      \"ssh\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThat same expression data.servers[i] when i has no value defines a query that returns all the values of i and data.servers[i]:\n> unset i\n> data.servers[i]\n+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| i |                                data.servers[i]                                |\n+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 0 | {\"id\":\"s1\",\"name\":\"app\",\"ports\":[\"p1\",\"p2\",\"p3\"],\"protocols\":[\"https\",\"ssh\"]} |\n| 1 | {\"id\":\"s2\",\"name\":\"db\",\"ports\":[\"p3\"],\"protocols\":[\"mysql\"]}                  |\n| 2 | {\"id\":\"s3\",\"name\":\"cache\",\"ports\":[\"p3\"],\"protocols\":[\"memcache\"]}            |\n| 3 | {\"id\":\"s4\",\"name\":\"dev\",\"ports\":[\"p1\",\"p2\"],\"protocols\":[\"http\"]}             |\n+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n4. Import and export documents.\nThe REPL also understands the Import and Package directives.\n> import data.servers\n> servers[i].ports[_] = \"p2\"; servers[i].id = id\n+---+------+\n| i |  id  |\n+---+------+\n| 0 | \"s1\" |\n| 3 | \"s4\" |\n+---+------+\n\n> package opa.example\n> public_servers[x].protocols[_] = \"http\"\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                 x                                 |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| {\"id\":\"s4\",\"name\":\"dev\",\"ports\":[\"p1\",\"p2\"],\"protocols\":[\"http\"]} |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n5. Define a rule to identify servers in violation of our security policy.\n> import data.servers\n> violations[s] {\n  s = servers[_]\n  s.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n  public_servers[s]\n}\n\n> violations[server]\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                              server                               |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| {\"id\":\"s4\",\"name\":\"dev\",\"ports\":[\"p1\",\"p2\"],\"protocols\":[\"http\"]} |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\nThe REPL accepts multi-line input and will change appearance when it detects multi-line input.\n\n"},"docker-authorization.html":{"url":"docker-authorization.html","title":"Docker Authorization","keywords":"","body":"Docker Authorization\nDocker’s out-of-the-box authorization model is all or nothing. But many users\nrequire finer-grained access control and Docker’s plugin infrastructure allows\nus to do so.\nThis is an excellent opportunity to see how to policy enable an existing\nservice.\nGoals\nThis tutorial helps you get started with OPA and introduces you to core concepts\nin OPA.\n\nPolicy enabling an application decouples the policy implementation from the\nbusiness logic so that administrators can define policy without changing the\napplication while still keeping up with the size, complexity, and dynamic\nnature of modern applications.\n\nFor the purpose of this tutorial, we want to use OPA to enforce a policy that\nprevents users from running insecure containers.\nThis tutorial illustrates two key concepts:\n\nOPA policy definition is decoupled from the implementation of the service\n(in this case Docker). The administrator is empowered to define and manage\npolicies without requiring changes to any of the apps.\n\nBoth the data relevant to policy and the policy definitions themselves can\nchange rapidly.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires:\n\nDocker Engine 1.11 or newer\nroot or sudo access\n\nThe tutorial has been tested on the following platforms:\n\nUbuntu 16.04 (64-bit)\n\nIf you are using a different distro, OS, or architecture, the steps will be the\nsame. However, there may be slight differences in the commands you need to run.\nSteps\n1. Create an empty policy definition that will allow all requests.\n$ mkdir policies && cat >policies/example.rego \nThis policy defines a single rule named allow that always produces the\ndecision true. Once all of the components are running, we will come back to\nthe policy.\n2. Run the opa-docker-authz plugin and then open another terminal.\n$ docker run -d --restart=always \\\n    -v $PWD/policies:/policies \\\n    -v /run/docker/plugins:/run/docker/plugins \\\n    openpolicyagent/opa-docker-authz:0.2 \\\n    -policy-file /policies/example.rego\n\n3. Reconfigure Docker.\nDocker must include the following command-line argument:\n--authorization-plugin=opa-docker-authz\n\nOn Ubuntu 16.04 with systemd, this can be done as follows (requires root):\n$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d\n$ sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf > /dev/null \nIf you are using a different Linux distribution or you are not running systemd,\nthe process will be slightly different.\n4. Run a simple Docker command to make sure everything is still working.\n$ docker ps\n\nIf everything is setup correctly, the command should exit successfully. You can\nexpect to see log messages from OPA and the plugin.\n5. Test that the policy definition is working.\nLet’s modify our policy to deny all requests:\n$ cat >policies/example.rego \nIn OPA, rules defines the content of documents. Documents be boolean values\n(true/false) or they can represent more complex structures using arrays,\nobjects, strings, etc.\nIn the example above we modified the policy to always return false so that\nrequests will be rejected.\n$ docker ps\n\nThe output should be:\nError response from daemon: authorization denied by plugin opa-docker-authz: request rejected by administrative policy\nTo learn more about how rules define the content of documents, see: How Does OPA Work?\nWith this policy in place, users will not be able to run any Docker commands. Go\nahead and try other commands such as docker run or docker pull. They will\nall be rejected.\nNow let's change the policy so that it's a bit more useful.\n6. Update the policy to reject requests with the unconfined seccomp profile:\n$ cat >policies/example.rego \n7. Test the policy is working by running a simple container:\n$ docker run hello-world\n\nNow try running the same container but disable seccomp (which should be\nprevented by the policy):\n$ docker run --security-opt seccomp:unconfined hello-world\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully prevented containers from running without\nseccomp!\nThe rest of the tutorial shows how you can grant fine grained access to specific\nclients.\n 8. Identify the user in Docker requests.\n\nBack up your existing Docker configuration, just in case. You can replace your\noriginal configuration after you are done with the tutorial.\n\n$ mkdir -p ~/.docker\n$ cp ~/.docker/config.json ~/.docker/config.json~\n\nTo identify the user, include an HTTP header in all of the requests sent to the\nDocker daemon:\n$ cat >~/.docker/config.json \n\nDocker does not currently provide a way to authenticate clients. But in Docker\n1.12, clients can be authenticated using TLS and there are plans to include\nother means of authentication. For the purpose of this tutorial, we assume that\nan authentication system is place.\n\n9. Update the policy to include basic user access controls.\n$ cat >policies/example.rego \n10. Attempt to run a container.\nBecause the configured user is \"bob\", the request is rejected:\n$ docker run hello-world\n\n11. Change the user to \"alice\" and re-run the container.\n$ cat > ~/.docker/config.json \nBecause the configured user is \"alice\", the request will succeed:\n$ docker run hello-world\n\n12.

Both OPA and\nthe web server will be run as containers.\nFor this tutorial, our desired policy is:\n\nPeople can see their own salaries (GET /finance/salary/{user} is permitted for {user})\nA manager can see their direct reports' salaries (GET /finance/salary/{user} is permitted for {user}'s manager)\n\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires Docker Compose to run a demo web server along with OPA.\nSteps\n1.

In this case, we have created an OPA-based plugin that can\nbe configured to authorize SSH and sudo access. The OPA-based Linux-PAM plugin\nused in this tutorial can be found at open-policy-agent/contrib.\nFor this tutorial, our desired policy is:\n\nAdmins can SSH into any host and run sudo commands.\nNormal users can SSH into hosts that they have contributed to and run sudo commands.\n\nFurthermore, we'll assume we have the following set of users and hosts:\n\nfrontend-dev is a developer who contributes to the app running on the frontend host.\nbackend-dev is a developer who contributes to the app running on the backend host.\nops is an administrator for the organization.\n\nAuthentication (verifying user identity) is outside the scope of OPA's\nresponsibility so this tutorial relies on identities being statically\ndefined. In real-world scenarios authentication can be delegated to SSH itself\n(authorized_keys) or other identity management systems.\nLet's get started.\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires Docker Compose to run dummy SSH hosts along\nwith OPA. The dummy SSH hosts are just containers running sshd inside.\nSteps\n1. Bootstrap the tutorial environment using Docker Compose.\nFirst, create a tutorial-docker-compose.yaml file that runs OPA and the containers that\nrepresent our backend and frontend hosts.\ncat > tutorial-docker-compose.yaml \nThe tutorial-docker-compose.yaml file requires two other local files:\nfrontend_host_id.json and backend_host_id.json. These files are mounted\ninto the containers representing our hosts. The content of the file provides\ncontext that the PAM module provides as input when executing queries\nagainst OPA.\nCreate the extra files required by tutorial-docker-compose.yaml:\necho '{\"host_id\": \"frontend\"}' > frontend_host_id.json\necho '{\"host_id\": \"backend\"}' > backend_host_id.json\n\n\nIn real-world scenarios, these files could contain arbitrary information that we want to expose to the policy.\n\nFinally, run docker-compose to pull and run the containers.\ndocker-compose -f tutorial-docker-compose.yaml up\n\nThis tutorial uses a special Docker image named openpolicyagent/demo-pam to simulate an SSH server.\nThis image contains pre-created Linux accounts for our users, and the required PAM module is\npre-configured inside the sudo and sshd files in /etc/pam.d/.\n2. Load policies and data into OPA.\nIn another terminal, load the policies and data into OPA that will control access to the hosts.\nFirst, create a policy that will tell the PAM module to collect context that is required for authorization.\nFor more details on what this policy should look like, see\nthis documentation.\ncat >pull.rego \nLoad this policy into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @pull.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/pull\n\nNext, create the policies that will authorize SSH and sudo requests.\nThe input which makes up the authorization context in the policy below will also\ninclude some default values, such as the username making the request. See\nthis documentation\nto get a better understanding of what the input to the authorization policy will look like.\nUnlike the pull policy, we'll create separate authz policies\nfor SSH and sudo for more fine-grained control.\nIn production, it makes more sense to have this separation for display and pull as well.\nCreate the SSH authorization policy. It should allow admins to SSH into all hosts,\nand non-admins to only SSH into hosts that they contributed code to.\ncat >sshd_authz.rego \nLoad this policy into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @sshd_authz.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/sshd/authz\n\nCreate the sudo authorization policy.

SSH and sudo as a user with the admin role.\nFirst, let's try to access the hosts as the ops user. Recall, the ops user\nhas been granted the admin role (via the PUT /data/roles request above) and\nusers with the admin role can login to any host and perform sudo commands.\nLogin to the frontend host (which has SSH listening on port 2222) and run a command with sudo as the ops user.\nssh -p 2222 ops@localhost \\\n  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\n\nsudo ls /\nexit\n\nYou will see a lot of verbose logs from sudo as the PAM module goes through the motions.\nThis is intended so you can study how the PAM module works.\nYou can disable verbose logging by changing the log_level argument in the PAM\nconfiguration. For more details see\nthis documentation.\n4. SSH as a user without the admin role.\nLet's try a user without the admin role. Recall, that a non-admin user can SSH\ninto any host that they have contributed to.\nThe frontend-dev user contributed code to the frontend host so they should be\nable to login.\nssh -p 2222 frontend-dev@localhost \\\n  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\n\nOnly admins can use sudo, so you shouldn't be able to run sudo ls /.\nSince frontend-dev did not contribute to the code running on the\nbackend host (which has SSH listening on port 2223), they should not be able\nto login.\nssh -p 2223 frontend-dev@localhost \\\n  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\n\n5. Elevate a user's rights through policy.\nSuppose you have a ticketing system for elevation, where you generate tickets for users\nthat need elevated rights, send the ticket to ther user, and expire those tickets when\ntheir rights should be removed.\nLet's mock the current state of this simple ticketing system's API with some data.\ncurl -X PUT localhost:8181/v1/data/elevate -d \\\n'{\n  \"tickets\": {\n    \"frontend-dev\": \"1234\"\n  }\n}'\n\nThis means that for now, if the frontend-dev user can provide ticket number 1234,\nthey should be able to SSH into all servers.\nLet's write policy to ensure that this happens.\nFirst, we need to make the PAM module take input from the user.\ncat >display.rego \nLoad this policy into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @display.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/display\n\nThen we need to make sure that the authorization takes this input into account.\ncat >sudo_authz_elevated.rego \nLoad this policy into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @sudo_authz_elevated.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/sudo_authz_elevated\n\nConfirm that the user frontend-dev can indeed use sudo.\nssh -p 2222 frontend-dev@localhost \\\n  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\n\nsudo ls /\n\nYou should be prompted with the message that we defined in our display policy\nfor both the SSH and sudo authorization cycles.\nThis happens because the display policy is shared by the PAM configurations of SSH and sudo.\nIn production, it is more practical to use separate policy packages for each PAM configuration.\nWe have not defined the SSH authz policy to work with elevation, so you can enter any value\ninto the prompt that comes up for for SSH.\nFor sudo, enter the ticket number 1234 to get access.\nLastly, update the mocked elevation API and confirm the user's original rights are restored.\ncurl -X PUT localhost:8181/v1/data/elevate -d \\\n'{\n  \"tickets\": {}\n}'\n\nYou will find that running sudo ls / as the frontend-dev user is disallowed again.\nIt is possible to configure the display policy to only make the PAM module prompt for the\nelevation ticket when our mock API has a non-empty tickets object. So when there are no\nelevated users, there will be no prompt for a ticket. This can be done using the Rego\ncount aggregate.\nWrap Up\nCongratulations for finishing the tutorial!\n You learned a number of things about SSH with OPA:\n\nOPA gives you fine-grained access control over SSH, sudo, and any other application that uses PAM.\nAlthough this tutorial used the some of the same policies for both\nSSH and sudo, you should use separate, fine-grained policies for each application that supports PAM.\nWriting allow/deny policies to control who has access to what using context from the user and host. \nImporting external data into OPA and writing policies that depend on that data.\n\nThe code for the PAM module used in this tutorial can be found in the\nopen-policy-agent/contrib\nrepository.\n"},"kubernetes-admission-control.html":{"url":"kubernetes-admission-control.html","title":"Kubernetes Admission Control","keywords":"","body":"Kubernetes Admission Control\nIn Kubernetes, Admission Controllers enforce semantic validation of objects during create, update, and delete operations. With OPA you can enforce custom policies on Kubernetes objects without recompiling or reconfiguring the Kubernetes API server.\nGoals\nThis tutorial shows how to enforce custom policies on Kubernetes objects using OPA. In this tutorial, you will define admission control rules that prevent users from creating Kubernetes Ingress objects that violate the following organization policy:\n\nIngress hostnames must be whitelisted on the Namespace containing the Ingress.\nTwo ingresses in different namespaces must not have the same hostname.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires Kubernetes 1.9 or later. To run the tutorial locally, we recommend using minikube.\nSteps\n1. Start Kubernetes recommended Admisson Controllers enabled\nTo implement admission control rules that validate Kubernetes resources during create, update, and delete operations, you must enable the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook when the Kubernetes API server is started. The recommended set of admission controllers to enable is defined below.\nADMISSION_CONTROLLERS=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,PersistentVolumeLabel,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,MutatingAdmissionWebhook,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,ResourceQuota\n\nStart minikube with these admission controllers enabled:\nminikube start --kubernetes-version v1.9.0 \\\n  --extra-config=apiserver.Admission.PluginNames=$ADMISSION_CONTROLLERS\n\nMake sure that the minikube ingress addon is enabled:\nminikube addons enable ingress\n\n2. Create a new Namespace to deploy OPA into\nWhen OPA is deployed on top of Kubernetes, policies are automatically loaded out of ConfigMaps in the opa namespace.\nkubectl create namespace opa\n\nConfigure kubectl to use this namespace:\nkubectl config set-context opa-tutorial --user minikube --cluster minikube --namespace opa\nkubectl config use-context opa-tutorial\n\n3. Deploy OPA on top of Kubernetes\nCommunication between Kubernetes and OPA must be secured using TLS. To configure TLS, use openssl to create a certificate authority (CA) and certificate/key pair for OPA:\nopenssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048\nopenssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -days 100000 -out ca.crt -subj \"/CN=admission_ca\"\n\nGenerate the TLS key and certificate for OPA:\ncat >server.conf \nopenssl genrsa -out server.key 2048\nopenssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj \"/CN=opa.opa.svc\" -config server.conf\nopenssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 100000 -extensions v3_req -extfile server.conf\n\n\nNote: the Common Name value you give to openssl MUST match the name of the OPA service created below.\n\nCreate a Secret to store the TLS credentials for OPA:\nkubectl create secret tls opa-server --cert=server.crt --key=server.key\n\nNext, use the file below to deploy OPA as an admission controller.\nadmission-controller.yaml:\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: opa\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: opa\n  ports:\n  - name: https\n    protocol: TCP\n    port: 443\n    targetPort: 443\n---\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: opa\n  name: opa\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: opa\n      name: opa\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - name: opa\n          image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.8.0\n          args:\n            - \"run\"\n            - \"--server\"\n            - \"--tls-cert-file=/certs/tls.crt\"\n            - \"--tls-private-key-file=/certs/tls.key\"\n            - \"--addr=0.0.0.0:443\"\n            - \"--insecure-addr=127.0.0.1:8181\"\n          volumeMounts:\n            - readOnly: true\n              mountPath: /certs\n              name: opa-server\n        - name: kube-mgmt\n          image: openpolicyagent/kube-mgmt:0.6\n          args:\n            - \"--replicate-cluster=v1/namespaces\"\n            - \"--replicate=extensions/v1beta1/ingresses\"\n      volumes:\n        - name: opa-server\n          secret:\n            secretName: opa-server\n---\nkind: ConfigMap\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: opa-default-system-main\ndata:\n  main: |\n    package system\n\n    import data.kubernetes.admission\n\n    main = {\n      \"apiVersion\": \"admission.k8s.io/v1beta1\",\n      \"kind\": \"AdmissionReview\",\n      \"response\": response,\n    }\n\n    default response = {\"allowed\": true}\n\n    response = {\n        \"allowed\": false,\n        \"status\": {\n            \"reason\": reason,\n        },\n    } {\n        reason = concat(\", \", admission.deny)\n        reason != \"\"\n    }\n\nkubectl apply -f admission-controller.yaml\n\nWhen OPA starts, the kube-mgmt container will load Kubernetes Namespace and Ingress objects into OPA. You can configure the sidecar to load any kind of Kubernetes object into OPA. The sidecar establishes watches on the Kubernetes API server so that OPA has access to an eventually consistent cache of Kubernetes objects.\nNext, generate the manifest that will be used to register OPA as an admission controller:\ncat > webhook-configuration.yaml \nThe generated configuration file inclues a base64 encoded representation of the CA certificate so that TLS connections can be established between the Kubernetes API server and OPA.\nFinally, register OPA as and admission controller:\nkubectl apply -f webhook-configuration.yaml\n\nYou can follow the OPA logs to see the webhook requests being issued by the Kubernetes API server:\nkubectl logs -l app=opa -c opa\n4. Define a policy and load it into OPA via Kubernetes\nTo test admission control, create a policy that restricts the hostnames that an ingress can use (ingress-whitelist.rego):\npackage kubernetes.admission\n\nimport data.kubernetes.namespaces\n\ndeny[msg] {\n    input.request.kind.kind = \"Ingress\"\n    input.request.operation = \"CREATE\"\n    host = input.request.object.spec.rules[_].host\n    not fqdn_matches_any(host, valid_ingress_hosts)\n    msg = sprintf(\"invalid ingress host %q\", [host])\n}\n\nvalid_ingress_hosts = {host |\n    whitelist = namespaces[input.request.namespace].metadata.annotations[\"ingress-whitelist\"]\n    hosts = split(whitelist, \",\")\n    host = hosts[_]\n}\n\nfqdn_matches_any(str, patterns) {\n    fqdn_matches(str, patterns[_])\n}\n\nfqdn_matches(str, pattern) {\n    pattern_parts = split(pattern, \".\")\n    pattern_parts[0] = \"*\"\n    str_parts = split(str, \".\")\n    n_pattern_parts = count(pattern_parts)\n    n_str_parts = count(str_parts)\n    suffix = trim(pattern, \"*.\")\n    endswith(str, suffix)\n}\n\nfqdn_matches(str, pattern) {\n    not contains(pattern, \"*\")\n    str = pattern\n}\n\n\nStore the policy in Kubernetes as a ConfigMap.\nkubectl create configmap ingress-whitelist --from-file=ingress-whitelist.rego\n\nThe OPA sidecar will notice the ConfigMap and automatically load the policy into OPA.\n5. Exercise the policy\nCreate two new namespaces to test the Ingress policy.\nqa-namespace.yaml:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    ingress-whitelist: \"*.qa.acmecorp.com,*.internal.acmecorp.com\"\n  name: qa\n\nproduction-namespace.yaml:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    ingress-whitelist: \"*.acmecorp.com\"\n  name: production\n\nkubectl create -f qa-namespace.yaml\nkubectl create -f production-namespace.yaml\n\nNext, define two Ingress objects. One of the Ingress objects will be permitted\nand the other will be rejected.\ningress-ok.yaml:\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: ingress-ok\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: signin.acmecorp.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - backend:\n          serviceName: nginx\n          servicePort: 80\n\ningress-bad.yaml:\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: ingress-bad\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: acmecorp.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - backend:\n          serviceName: nginx\n          servicePort: 80\n\nFinally, try to create both Ingress objects:\nkubectl create -f ingress-ok.yaml -n production\nkubectl create -f ingress-bad.yaml -n qa\n\nThe second Ingress is rejected because it's hostname does not match the whitelist in the qa namespace.\n6. Modify the policy and exercise the changes\nOPA allows you to modify policies on-the-fly without recompiling any of the services that offload policy decisions to it.\nTo enforce the second half of the policy from the start of this tutorial you can load another policy into OPA that rejects Ingress objects in different namespaces from sharing the same hostname.\ningress-conflicts.rego:\npackage kubernetes.admission\n\nimport data.kubernetes.ingresses\n\ndeny[msg] {\n    input.request.kind.kind = \"Ingress\"\n    input.request.operation = \"CREATE\"\n    host = input.request.object.spec.rules[_].host\n    ingress = ingresses[other_ns][other_ingress]\n    other_ns != input.request.namespace\n    ingress.spec.rules[_].host = host\n    msg = sprintf(\"invalid ingress host %q (conflicts with %v/%v)\", [host, other_ns, other_ingress])\n}\n\n\nkubectl create configmap ingress-conflicts --from-file=ingress-conflicts.rego\n\nThe OPA sidecar annotates ConfigMaps containing policies to indicate if they\nwere installed successfully. Verify the ConfigMap was installed successfully.\nkubectl get configmap ingress-conflicts -o yaml\nTest that you cannot create an Ingress in another namespace with the same hostname as the one created earlier.\nstaging-namespace.yaml:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    ingress-whitelist: \"*.acmecorp.com\"\n  name: staging\nkubectl create -f staging-namespace.yaml\n\nkubectl create -f ingress-ok.yaml -n staging\n\nWrap Up\nCongratulations for finishing the tutorial!\nThis tutorial showed how you can leverage OPA to enforce admission control\ndecisions in Kubernetes clusters without modifying or recompiling any\nKubernetes components. Furthermore, once Kubernetes is configured to use OPA as\nan External Admission Controller, policies can be modified on-the-fly to\nsatisfy changing operational requirements.\nFor more information about deploying OPA on top of Kubernetes, see\nDeployments - Kubernetes.\n"},"terraform.html":{"url":"terraform.html","title":"Terraform Testing","keywords":"","body":"Terraform Testing\nTerraform lets you describe the infrastructure you want and automatically creates, deletes, and modifies\nyour existing infrastructure to match.

Evaluate the OPA policy on the Terraform plan\nTo evaluate the policy against that plan, you hand OPA the policy, the Terraform plan as input, and\nask it to evaluate data.terraform.analysis.authz.\nopa run terraform.rego repl.input:tfplan.json -e \"data.terraform.analysis.authz\"\n\nIf you're curious, you can ask for the score that the policy used to make the authorization decision.\nIn our example, it is 11 (10 for the creation of the auto-scaling group and 1 for the creation of the server).\nopa run terraform.rego repl.input:tfplan.json -e \"data.terraform.analysis.score\"\n\nIf as suggested in the previous step, you want to modify your policy to make an authorization decision\nbased on both the user and the Terraform plan, the input you would give to OPA would take the form\n{\"user\": , \"plan\": }, and your policy would reference the user with input.user and\nthe plan with input.plan.  You could even go so far as to provide the Terraform state file and the AWS\nEC2 data to OPA and write policy using all of that context.\n5. Create a Large Terraform plan and Evaluate it\nCreate a Terraform plan that creates enough resources to exceed the blast-radius permitted\nby policy.  \ncat >main.tf \nGenerate the Terraform plan and convert it to JSON.\nterraform plan --out tfplan_large.binary\ntfjson tfplan_large.binary > tfplan_large.json\n\nEvaluate the policy to see that it fails the policy tests and check the score.\nopa run terraform.rego repl.input:tfplan_large.json -e \"data.terraform.analysis.authz\"\nopa run terraform.rego repl.input:tfplan_large.json -e \"data.terraform.analysis.score\"\n\n6. (Optional) Run OPA as a daemon and evaluate policy\nIn addition to running OPA from the command-line, you can run it as a daemon loaded with the Terraform policy and\nthen interact with it using its HTTP API.  First, start the daemon:\nopa run -s terraform.rego\n\nThen in a separate terminal, use OPA's HTTP API to evaluate the policy against the two Terraform plans.\ncurl localhost:8181/v0/data/terraform/analysis/authz -d @tfplan.json\ncurl localhost:8181/v0/data/terraform/analysis/authz -d @tfplan_large.json\n\nWrap Up\nCongratulations for finishing the tutorial!\nYou learned a number of things about Terraform Testing with OPA:\n\nOPA gives you fine-grained policy control over Terraform plans.\nYou can use data other than the plan itself (e.g. the user) when writing authorization policies.\n\nKeep in mind that it's up to you to decide how to use OPA's Terraform tests and authorization decision.  Here are some ideas.\n\nAdd it as part of your Terraform wrapper to implement unit tests on Terraform plans\nUse it to automatically approve run-of-the-mill Terraform changes to reduce the burden of peer-review\nEmbed it into your deployment system to catch problems that arise when applying Terraform to production after applying it to staging\n\n"}}}
