policy is a set of rules that governs the behavior of a service.\nPolicy-enablement empowers users to read, write, and manage these rules without\nneeding specialized development or operational expertise. When your users can\nimplement policies without recompiling your source code, then your service is\npolicy enabled.\nWhat is Policy?\nAll organizations have policies. Policies are essential to the long-term\nsuccess of organizations because they encode important knowledge about how to\ncomply with legal requirements, work within technical constraints, avoid\nrepeating mistakes, and so on.\nIn their simplest form, policies can be applied manually based on rules that\nare written down or conventions that are unspoken but permeate an\norganization’s culture. Policies may also be enforced with application logic or\nstatically configured at deploy time.\nWhat is Policy Enablement?\nPolicy-enabled services allow policies to be specified declaratively, updated\nat any time without recompiling or redeploying, and enforced automatically\n(which is especially valuable when decisions need to be made faster than\nhumanly possible). They make deployments more adaptable to changing business\nrequirements, improve the ability to discover violations and conflicts,\nincrease the consistency of policy compliance, and mitigate the risk of human\nerror.\nA policy-enabled service is able to answer questions by comparing relevant\ninput from its environment to policy statements written by administrators. For\nexample, a cloud computing service could answer questions such as:\n\nCan I add compute capacity?\nIn what regions can I add compute capacity?\nWhich instances are currently running in the wrong region?\n\nWhat is OPA?\nOPA is a lightweight general-purpose policy engine that can be co-located with\nyour service. You can integrate OPA as a sidecar, host-level daemon, or\nlibrary.\nServices offload policy decisions to OPA by executing queries. OPA evaluates\npolicies and data to produce query results (which are sent back to the client).\nPolicies are written in a high-level declarative language and can be loaded\ninto OPA via the filesystem or well-defined APIs.\nWhy use OPA?\n\n"},"how-does-opa-work.html":{"url":"how-does-opa-work.html","title":"How Does OPA Work?","keywords":"","body":"How Does OPA Work?\nOPA is a full-featured policy engine that offloads policy decisions from your service. You can think of it as a concierge for your service who can answer detailed questions on behalf of your users to meet their specific needs.\nOverview\nOPA’s RESTful APIs use JSON over HTTP so you and your users can integrate OPA with any programming language. At a high level, integrating OPA into your service involves:\n\nDeploying OPA alongside your service\nPushing relevant data about your service’s state into OPA’s document store\nOffloading some or all decision-making to OPA by querying it\n\nWhen your service is integrated with OPA, your users will be able author and deploy custom policies that control the behavior of your service’s policy-enabled features. Furthermore, users can publish data to OPA that is not available to your service about their own deployment context.\n\nIn the future, both your service and its users will be able to register for, and react to, notifications triggered when OPA detects a policy-relevant change.\nDeployment\nUnless you embed OPA as a Go library, you will deploy it alongside your service – either directly as an operating system daemon or inside a container. In this way, transactions will have low latency and availability will be determined through shared fate with your service.\nWhen OPA starts for the first time, it will not contain any policies or data. Policies and data can be added, removed, and modified at any time. For example: by deployment automation software or your service as it is deployed, by your service during an upgrade, or by administrators as needed.\nData and Policies\nThe primary unit of data in OPA is a document, which is similar to a JSON value. Documents typically correspond to single, self-contained objects and are capable of representing both primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) as well as structured types (objects, and arrays). Documents are created, read, updated, and deleted via OPA’s RESTful HTTP APIs.\n\nBase Documents\nSo-called base documents contain static, structured data stored in memory and optionally saved to disk for resiliency. Your service will publish and update base documents in order to describe its current state, and your users can do the same to include relevant data about the state of their own deployment context.\nBase documents are published and updated using OPA’s Data API. For example, the following request publishes a list of servers to OPA:\nPATCH https://example.com/v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json-patch+json\n\n[\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s1\",\n      \"name\": \"app\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\",\n        \"https\",\n        \"ssh\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\",\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s2\",\n      \"name\": \"db\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"mysql\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s3\",\n      \"name\": \"cache\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"memcache\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s4\",\n      \"name\": \"dev\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\",\n        \"https\",\n        \"ssh\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nPolicies\nPolicies are written using OPA’s purpose-built, declarative language Rego. Rego includes rich support for traversing nested documents and transforming data using syntax inspired by dictionary and array access in languages like Python and JSONPath. For detailed information about using Rego, see How Do I Write Policies?.\nEach Rego file defines a policy module using a collection of rules that describe the expected state of your service. Both your service and its users can publish and update policy modules using OPA’s Policy API. For example, the following request creates a policy with two rules (violations and public_servers) named “exempli-gratia”:\nPUT https://example.com/v1/policies/exempli-gratia HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport data.servers\nimport data.networks\nimport data.ports\n\nviolations[server] {\n    server = servers[_]\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n    public_servers[server] = true\n}\n\npublic_servers[server] {\n    server = servers[_]\n    server.ports[_] = ports[i].id\n    ports[i].networks[_] = networks[j].id\n    networks[j].public = true\n}\n\nA policy file must contain a single package declaration, which defines the path to the policy module and its rules (for example, data.opa.examples.violations – see The data Document for more information about accessing nested documents). The policy name itself (in this case, “exempli-gratia”) is only used to identify policies for file management purposes; it is not used otherwise.\n Rules and Virtual Documents\nIn contrast to base documents, virtual documents embody the results of evaluating the rules included in policy modules. Virtual documents are computed when users publish new policy modules, update existing modules, run queries, and when any relevant base document is published or updated. Rules allow policy authors to write questions with yes-no answers (that is, predicates) and to generate structured values from raw data found in base documents as well as from intermediate data found in other virtual documents.\n The data Document\nAll documents pushed into OPA or computed by rules are nested under a built-in root document named data.\n\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"servers\": [...],\n    \"ports\": [...],\n    \"networks\": [...],\n    \"opa\": {\n      \"examples\": {\n        \"violations\": [...],\n        \"public_servers\": [...]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAs a result, any document, base or virtual, can be accessed hierarchically starting from the root data node – either as an identifier:\nimport data.servers                            # Base document\nimport data.opa.examples.violations            # Virtual document\n\nor as a URI component in an HTTP request:\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\n\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/opa/examples/violations HTTP/1.1\n\n The input Document\nIn some cases, to evaluate a policy, the query must specify additional documents\nas arguments.\nQuery arguments are nested under a built-in root document named input (similar to data).\n{\n  \"input\": {\n      \"method\": \"GET\",\n      \"path\": \"/servers/s2\",\n      \"user\": \"alice\"\n  }\n}\n\nQuery arguments can be accessed hierarchically starting from the root input\nnode:\nallow { input.user = \"alice\" }\n\nJust like state stored in OPA, documents supplied with the query can be aliased:\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport input.method\nimport input.user\n\n# allow \"bob\" to perform read-only operations\nallow { user = \"bob\"; method = \"GET\" }\n\n# allow \"alice\" to perform any operation\nallow { user = \"alice\" }\n\nPutting It All Together\nLet’s take a look at some documents representing the state of a hypothetical service and a policy module that uses this data. The following documents describe a set of servers, the protocols they use, the ports they open, and the networks those ports are connected to.\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"servers\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"s1\",\n        \"name\": \"app\",\n        \"protocols\": [\n          \"https\",\n          \"ssh\"\n        ],\n        \"ports\": [\n          \"p1\",\n          \"p2\",\n          \"p3\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"s2\",\n        \"name\": \"db\",\n        \"protocols\": [\n          \"mysql\"\n        ],\n        \"ports\": [\n          \"p3\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"s3\",\n        \"name\": \"cache\",\n        \"protocols\": [\n          \"memcache\",\n          \"http\"\n        ],\n        \"ports\": [\n          \"p3\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"s4\",\n        \"name\": \"dev\",\n        \"protocols\": [\n          \"http\"\n        ],\n        \"ports\": [\n          \"p1\",\n          \"p2\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"networks\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"n1\",\n        \"public\": false\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"n2\",\n        \"public\": false\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"n3\",\n        \"public\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"ports\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"p1\",\n        \"networks\": [\n          \"n1\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"p2\",\n        \"networks\": [\n          \"n3\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"p3\",\n        \"networks\": [\n          \"n2\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nWhen the data is published, we can use OPA’s API to inspect base documents like servers:\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\n\nThe response is an object that contains the array of servers:\n{\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s1\",\n      \"name\": \"app\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"https\",\n        \"ssh\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\",\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s2\",\n      \"name\": \"db\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"mysql\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s3\",\n      \"name\": \"cache\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"memcache\",\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s4\",\n      \"name\": \"dev\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nNow let’s write a policy that enumerates servers that are connected to public networks and that are using HTTP. These servers are violating a business rule that states that all public servers must use HTTPS.\n# This policy module belongs the opa.example package.\npackage opa.examples\n\n# Refer to data.servers as `servers`.\nimport data.servers\n# Refer to the data.networks as `networks`.\nimport data.networks\n# Refer to the data.ports as `ports`.\nimport data.ports\n\n# A server exists in the violations set if...\nviolations[server] {\n    # ...the server exists\n    server = servers[_]\n    # ...and any of the server’s protocols is HTTP\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n    # ...and the server is public.\n    public_servers[server] = true\n}\n\n# A server exists in the public_servers set if...\npublic_servers[server] {\n    # ...the server exists\n    server = servers[_]\n    # ...and the server is connected to a port\n    server.ports[_] = ports[i].id\n    # ...and the port is connected to a network\n    ports[i].networks[_] = networks[j].id\n    # ...and the network is public.\n    networks[j].public = true\n}\n\nNote that:\n\nRules consist of assertions about data stored in OPA. In this case, the assertions test for equality with, and membership of, values in the servers, networks, and ports documents.\nExpressions can reference elements in a collection using the [_] and [] syntax. OPA knows to evaluate such queries by iterating over each element in the corresponding collection.\nAssertions about elements in a collection are true if any of the elements match the expression, and are only false when none of the elements match. For example, ports[i].networks[_] = networks[j].id will be true whenever any element in ports[i].networks matches the id of any element in networks.\nExpressions can reference nested documents. For example,ports[i].networks[_] refers to each network ID listed in each port document.\nExpressions can reference virtual documents. For example, public_servers[server] = true matches only if server is in the list produced by the public_servers rule.\n\nAfter publishing this policy module, data will include additional documents corresponding to the module’s package declaration (opa.examples) and the virtual documents its rules generate.\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"servers\": [...],\n    \"networks\": [...],\n    \"ports\": [...],\n    \"opa\": {\n      \"examples\": {\n        \"violations\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"s4\",\n            \"name\": \"dev\",\n            \"protocols\": [\n              \"http\"\n            ],\n            \"ports\": [\n              \"p1\",\n              \"p2\"\n            ]\n          }\n        ],\n        \"public_servers\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"s1\",\n            \"name\": \"app\",\n            \"protocols\": [\n              \"https\",\n              \"ssh\"\n            ],\n            \"ports\": [\n              \"p1\",\n              \"p2\",\n              \"p3\"\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"id\": \"s4\",\n            \"name\": \"dev\",\n            \"protocols\": [\n              \"http\"\n            ],\n            \"ports\": [\n              \"p1\",\n              \"p2\"\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIf we use OPA’s API to inspect the violations virtual document…\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/opa/examples/violations HTTP/1.1\n\n…the response is the subset of the servers base document that use HTTP and are connected to a public network:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s4\",\n      \"name\": \"dev\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nFuture Features\nOPA is under active development. The following features are planned but not yet implemented.\nTriggers\nYour service and its users can register to be notified when the system exits the expected state so that violations can be remediated automatically.\nAny rule can be used as the trigger for a notification. For example, let’s assume that you want to migrate containers to a new host if their current host shuts down. You need a rule to detect when there are containers assigned to hosts that are no longer running.\n# All production containers are running if...\ncontainers_to_migrate[id] {\n    # ...the container exists\n    container = containers[id]\n    # ...and it is in production\n    container.site.name = \"prod\"\n    # ...and its host is running.\n    container.host.state != \"terminated\"\n}\n\nThis rule produces a list of containers that should be migrated. You can register to observe this rule, and when the underlying data changes, OPA will re-evaluate it and trigger a notification. You can handle the event by re-deploying the containers in the resulting list to a running host.\nTransactions\nOPA APIs support transactional operations. Either all of the operations within a transaction succeed or the whole transaction fails. For example, to deploy a new virtual machine, you might:\n\nOpen a new transaction.\nQuery OPA for a list of hosts where the VM can be deployed.\nDeploy the VM to host from the list.\nPush data about the new deployment into OPA’s document store.\nClose the transaction.\n\nIf any of steps 2–4 fail, so will the transaction.\n"},"how-do-i-write-policies.html":{"url":"how-do-i-write-policies.html","title":"How Do I Write Policies?","keywords":"","body":"How Do I Write Policies?\nOPA is purpose built for reasoning about information represented in structured\ndocuments. The data that your service and its users publish can be inspected and\ntransformed using OPA’s native query language Rego.\nWhat is Rego?\nRego was inspired by Datalog, which is\na well understood, decades old query language. Rego extends Datalog to support\nstructured document models such as JSON.\nRego queries are assertions on data stored in OPA. These queries can be used to\ndefine policies that enumerate instances of data that violate the expected state\nof the system.\nWhy use Rego?\nUse Rego for defining policy that is easy to read and write.\nRego focuses on providing powerful support for referencing nested documents and\nensuring that queries are correct and unambiguous.\nRego is declarative so policy authors can focus on what queries should return\nrather than how queries should be executed. These queries are simpler and more\nconcise than the equivalent in an imperative language.\nLike other applications which support declarative query languages, OPA is able\nto optimize queries to improve performance.\nThe Basics\nThis section introduces the main aspects of Rego.\nThe simplest rule is a single expression and is defined in terms of a Scalar Value:\npi = 3.14159\n\nRules define the content of documents. We can query for the content of the pi document generated by the rule above:\n> pi\n3.14159\n\nRules can also be defined in terms of Composite Values:\nrect = {\"width\": 2, \"height\": 4}\n\nThe result:\n> rect\n{\n  \"height\": 4,\n  \"width\": 2\n}\n\nMany expressions are defined in terms of Equality. These expressions can be thought of as assertions. The simplest example of a rule containing an equality expression involves two scalar values:\nv { \"hello\" = \"world\" }\n\nWe can evaluate v to check if it is equal to true:\n> v = true\nfalse\n\nThe order of operands in an equality expression does not matter. The result is the same:\n> true = v\nfalse\n\nIf we evaluate v on its own, the REPL prints undefined because the body of the rule never evaluates to true. As a result, the document generated by the rule is not defined.\n> v\nundefined\n\nWe can define rules in terms of Variables as well:\nt { x = 42; y = 41; x > y }\n\nThe formal syntax uses the semicolon character ; to separate expressions. Rule\nbodies can separate expressions with newlines and omit the semicolon:\nt2 {\n    x = 42\n    y = 41\n    x > 1\n}\nWhen evaluating rule bodies, OPA searches for variable bindings that make all of\nthe expressions true. There may be multiple sets of bindings that make the rule\nbody true. The rule body can be understood intuitively as:\nexpression-1 AND expression-2 AND ... AND expression-N\nThe rule itself can be understood intuitvely as:\nrule-name IS value IF body\nIf the value is omitted, it defaults to true.\nWhen we query for the contents of t we see the obvious result:\n> t\ntrue\n\nThe order of expressions in a rule does not affect the document’s content:\ns {\n    x > y\n    y = 41\n    x = 42\n}\n\nThe query result is the same:\n> s\ntrue\n\nRego References help you refer to nested documents. For example:\nsites = [{\"name\": \"prod\"}, {\"name\": \"smoke1\"}, {\"name\": \"dev\"}]\n\nr { sites[i].name = \"prod\" }\n\nThe rule r above asserts that there exists (at least) one document within sites where the name attribute equals \"prod\".\nThe result:\n> r\ntrue\n\nWe can generalize the example above with a rule that defines a set document instead of a boolean document:\nq[name] { sites[i].name = name }\n\nWhen we query for q we obtain a set of names:\n> q[x]\n+----------+\n|    x     |\n+----------+\n| \"prod\"   |\n| \"smoke1\" |\n| \"dev\"    |\n+----------+\n\nWe can re-write the rule r from above to make use of q. We will call the new rule p:\np { q[\"prod\"] }\n\nThe result will be the same:\n> p\ntrue\n\nRules which have arguments can be queried with input values:\n> q[\"smoke2\"]\nundefined\n> q[\"dev\"]\ntrue\n\nIf you made it this far, congratulations!\nThis section introduced the main aspects of Rego. The rest of this document\nwalks through each part of the language in more detail.\nFor a concise reference, see the Language\nReference document.\n Scalar Values\nScalar values are the simplest type of term in Rego. Scalar values can be strings, numbers, booleans, or null.\nDocuments can be defined solely in terms of scalar values. This is useful for defining constants that are referenced in multiple places. For example:\ngreeting   = \"Hello\"\nmax_height = 42\npi         = 3.14159\nallowed    = true\nsentinel   = null\n\nThese documents can be queried like any other:\n> greeting\n\"Hello\"\n> max_height\n42\n> pi\n3.14159\n> allowed\ntrue\n> sentinel\nnull\n\n Composite Values\nComposite values define collections. In simple cases, composite values can be treated as constants like Scalar Values:\ncube = {\"width\": 3, \"height\": 4, \"depth\": 5}\n\nThe result:\n> cube.width\n3\n\nComposite values can also be defined in terms of Variables or References. For example:\n> a = 42; b = false; c = null; d = {\"a\": a, \"x\": [b, c]}\n+----+-------+------+---------------------------+\n| A  |   B   |  C   |             D             |\n+----+-------+------+---------------------------+\n| 42 | false | null | {\"a\":42,\"x\":[false,null]} |\n+----+-------+------+---------------------------+\n\nBy defining composite values in terms of variables and references, rules can define abstractions over raw data and other rules.\nSets\nIn addition to arrays and objects, Rego supports set values. Sets are unordered\ncollections of unique values. Just like other composite values, sets can be\ndefined in terms of scalars, variables, references, and other composite values.\nFor example:\n> s = {cube.width, cube.height, cube.depth}; count(s, n)\n+---+---------+\n| n |    s    |\n+---+---------+\n| 3 | [5,4,3] |\n+---+---------+\n\n\nSet documents are collections of values without keys. OPA represents set\ndocuments as arrays when serializing to JSON or other formats that do not\nsupport a set data type. The important distinction between sets and arrays or\nobjects is that sets are unkeyed while arrays and objects are keyed, i.e., you\ncannot refer to the index of an element within a set.\n\nWhen comparing sets, the order of elements does not matter:\n> {1,2,3} = {3,1,2}\ntrue\nBecause sets are unordered, variables inside sets must be unified with a ground\nvalue outside of the set. If the variable is not unified with a ground value\noutside the set, OPA will complain:\n> {1,2,3} = {3,x,2}\n1 error occurred: 1:1: rego_unsafe_var_error: var x is unsafe\n\nBecause sets share curly-brace syntax with objects, and an empty object is\ndefined with {}, an empty set has to be constructed with a different syntax:\n> count(set(), n)\n+---+\n| n |\n+---+\n| 0 |\n+---+\n\n Variables\nVariables are another kind of term in Rego. They appear in both the head and body of rules.\nVariables appearing in the head of a rule can be thought of as input and output of the rule. Unlike many programming languages, where a variable is either an input or an output, in Rego a variable is simultaneously an input and an output. If a query supplies a value for a variable, that variable is an input, and if the query does not supply a value for a variable, that variable is an output.\nFor example:\nsites = [\n    {\"name\": \"prod\"},\n    {\"name\": \"smoke1\"},\n    {\"name\": \"dev\"}\n]\n\nq[name] { sites[i].name = name }\n\nIn this case, we evaluate q with a variable x (which is not bound to a value). As as result, the query returns all of the site names.\n> q[x]\n+----------+\n|    x     |\n+----------+\n| \"prod\"   |\n| \"smoke1\" |\n| \"dev\"    |\n+----------+\n\nOn the other hand, if we evaluate q with an input value for name we can determine whether name exists in the document defined by q:\n> q[\"smoke2\"]\nundefined\n> q[\"dev\"]\ntrue\n\nVariables appearing in the head of a rule must also appear in a non-negated equality expression within the same rule. This property ensures that if the rule is evaluated and all of the expressions evaluate to true for some set of variable bindings, the variable in the head of the rule will be defined.\n References\nReferenced are used to access nested documents.\nThe examples in this section use the data defined in the Examples section.\nThe simplest reference contains no variables. For example, the following reference returns the hostname of the second server in the first site document from our example data:\n> sites[0].servers[1].hostname\n\"helium\"\n\nReferences are typically written using the “dot-access” style. The canonical form does away with . and closely resembles dictionary lookup in a language such as Python:\n> sites[0][\"servers\"][1][\"hostname\"]\n\"helium\"\n\nBoth forms are valid, however, the dot-access style is typically more readable. Note that there are two cases where brackets must be used:\n\nString keys containing characters other than [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], or _ (underscore).\nNon-string keys such as numbers, booleans, and null.\nVariable keys which are described later.\n\nReferences are always prefixed with a variable that identifies the root\ndocument. In the example above this is p. The root document may be:\n\na local variable inside a rule.\na rule inside the same package.\na document stored in OPA.\na documented temporarily provided to OPA as part of a transaction.\n\nVariable Keys\nReferences can include variables as keys. References written this way are used to select a value from every element in a collection.\nThe following reference will select the hostnames of all the servers in our\nexample data:\n> sites[i].servers[j].hostname\n+---+---+------------------------------+\n| i | j | sites[i].servers[j].hostname |\n+---+---+------------------------------+\n| 0 | 0 | \"hydrogen\"                   |\n| 0 | 1 | \"helium\"                     |\n| 0 | 2 | \"lithium\"                    |\n| 1 | 0 | \"beryllium\"                  |\n| 1 | 1 | \"boron\"                      |\n| 1 | 2 | \"carbon\"                     |\n| 2 | 0 | \"nitrogen\"                   |\n| 2 | 1 | \"oxygen\"                     |\n+---+---+------------------------------+\n\nConceptually, this is the same as the following imperative (Python) code:\ndef hostnames(sites):\n    result = []\n    for site in sites:\n        for server in site.servers:\n            result.append(server.hostname)\n    return result\n\nIn the reference above, we effectively used variables named i and j to iterate the collections. If the variables are unused outside the reference, we prefer to replace them with an underscore (_) character. The reference above can be rewritten as:\n> sites[_].servers[_].hostname\n+------------------------------+\n| sites[_].servers[_].hostname |\n+------------------------------+\n| \"hydrogen\"                   |\n| \"helium\"                     |\n| \"lithium\"                    |\n| \"beryllium\"                  |\n| \"boron\"                      |\n| \"carbon\"                     |\n| \"nitrogen\"                   |\n| \"oxygen\"                     |\n+------------------------------+\n\nThe underscore is special because it cannot be referred to by other parts of the rule, e.g., the other side of the expression, another expression, etc. The underscore can be thought of as a special iterator. Each time an underscore is specified, a new iterator is instantiated.\n\nUnder the hood, OPA translates the _ character to a unique variable name that does not conflict with variables and rules that are in scope.\n\nMultiple Expressions\nRules are often written in terms of multiple expressions that contain references to documents. In the following example, the rule defines a set of arrays where each array contains an application name and a hostname of a server where the application is deployed.\napps_and_hostnames[[name, hostname]] {\n    apps[i].name = name\n    apps[i].servers[_] = server\n    sites[j].servers[k].name = server\n    sites[j].servers[k].hostname = hostname\n}\n\nThe result:\n> apps_and_hostnames[x]\n+----------------------+\n|          x           |\n+----------------------+\n| [\"web\",\"hydrogen\"]   |\n| [\"web\",\"helium\"]     |\n| [\"web\",\"beryllium\"]  |\n| [\"web\",\"boron\"]      |\n| [\"web\",\"nitrogen\"]   |\n| [\"mysql\",\"lithium\"]  |\n| [\"mysql\",\"carbon\"]   |\n| [\"mongodb\",\"oxygen\"] |\n+----------------------+\n\nDon’t worry about understanding everything in this example right now. There are just two important points:\n\nSeveral variables appear more than once in the body. When a variable is used in multiple locations, OPA will only produce documents for the rule with the variable bound to the same value in all expressions.\nThe rule is joining the apps and sites documents implicitly. In Rego (and other languages based on Datalog), joins are implicit.\n\nSelf-Joins\nUsing a different key on the same array or object provides the equivalent of self-join in SQL. For example, the following rule defines a document containing apps deployed on the same site as \"mysql\":\nsame_site[apps[k].name] {\n    apps[i].name = \"mysql\"\n    apps[i].servers[_] = server\n    sites[j].servers[_].name = server\n    sites[j].servers[_].name = other_server\n    server != other_server\n    apps[k].servers[_] = other_server\n}\n\nThe result:\n> same_site[x]\n+-------+\n|   x   |\n+-------+\n| \"web\" |\n| \"web\" |\n| \"web\" |\n| \"web\" |\n+-------+\n\n Comprehensions\nComprehensions provide a concise way of building Composite Values from sub-queries.\nLike Rules, comprehensions consist of a head and a body. The body of a comprehension can be understood in exactly the same way as the body of a rule, that is, one or more expressions that must all be true in order for the overall body to be true. When the body evaluates to true, the head of the comprehension is evaluated to produce an element in the result.\nThe body of a comprehension is able to refer to variables defined in the outer body. For example:\n> region = \"west\", names = [name | sites[i].region = region, sites[i].name = name]\n+-----------------+--------+\n|      names      | region |\n+-----------------+--------+\n| [\"smoke\",\"dev\"] | \"west\" |\n+-----------------+--------+\n\nIn the above query, the second expression contains an Array Comprehension that refers to the region variable. The region variable will be bound in the outer body.\n\nWhen a comprehension refers to a variable in an outer body, OPA will reorder expressions in the outer body so that variables referred to in the comprehension are bound by the time the comprehension is evaluated.\n\nComprehensions are similar to the same constructs found in other languages like Python. For example, we could write the above comprehension in Python as follows:\n# Python equivalent of Rego comprehension shown above.\nnames = [site.name for site in sites if site.region = \"west\"]\n\nComprehensions are often used to group elements by some key. A common use case for comprehensions is to assist in computing aggregate values (e.g., the number of containers running on a host).\n Array Comprehensions\nArray Comprehensions build array values out of sub-queries. Array Comprehensions have the form:\n[  |  ]\n\nFor example, the following rule defines an object where the keys are application names and the values are hostnames of servers where the application is deployed. The hostnames of servers are represented as an array.\napp_to_hostnames[app_name] = hostnames {\n    apps[_] = app\n    app_name = app.name\n    hostnames = [hostname | name = app.servers[_]\n                            sites[_].servers[_] = s\n                            s.name = name\n                            hostname = s.hostname]\n}\n\nThe result:\n> app_to_hostnames[app] = hostnames\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n|    app    |                      hostnames                       |\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n| \"web\"     | [\"hydrogen\",\"helium\",\"beryllium\",\"boron\",\"nitrogen\"] |\n| \"mysql\"   | [\"lithium\",\"carbon\"]                                 |\n| \"mongodb\" | [\"oxygen\"]                                           |\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n\nIn the future, Rego will support Set and Object comprehensions.\n Rules\nRules define the content of Virtual Documents in\nOPA. When OPA evaluates a rule, we say OPA generates the content of the\ndocument that is defined by the rule.\nThe sample code in this section make use of the data defined in Examples.\n Generating Sets\nThe following rule defines a set containing the hostnames of all servers:\nhostnames[name] { sites[_].servers[_].hostname = name }\n\nWhen we query for the content of hostnames we see the same data as we would if we queried using the sites[_].servers[_].hostname reference directly:\n> hostnames[name]\n+-------------+\n|    name     |\n+-------------+\n| \"hydrogen\"  |\n| \"helium\"    |\n| \"lithium\"   |\n| \"beryllium\" |\n| \"boron\"     |\n| \"carbon\"    |\n| \"nitrogen\"  |\n| \"oxygen\"    |\n+-------------+\n\nThis example introduces a few important aspects of Rego.\nFirst, the rule defines a set document where the contents are defined by the variable name. We know this rule defines a set document because the head only includes a key. All rules have the following form (where key, value, and body are all optional):\n ? ? ?\nFor a more formal definition of the rule syntax, see the Language Reference document.\nSecond, the sites[_].servers[_].hostname fragment selects the hostname attribute from all of the objects in the servers collection. From reading the fragment in isolation we cannot tell whether the fragment refers to arrays or objects. We only know that it refers to a collections of values.\nThird, the sites[_].servers[_].hostname = name expression binds the value of the hostname attribute to the variable name, which is also declared in the head of the rule.\n Generating Objects\nRules that define objects are very similar to rules that define sets.\napps_by_hostname[hostname] = app {\n    sites[_].servers[_] = server\n    server.hostname = hostname\n    apps[i].servers[_] = server.name\n    apps[i].name = app\n}\n\nThe rule above defines an object that maps hostnames to app names. The main difference between this rule and one which defines a set is the rule head: in addition to declaring a key, the rule head also declares a value for the document.\nThe result:\n> apps_by_hostname[\"helium\"] = app\n+-------+\n|  app  |\n+-------+\n| \"web\" |\n+-------+\n Incremental Definitions\nA rule may be defined multiple times with the same name. When a rule is defined\nthis way, we refer to the rule definition as incremental because each\ndefinition is additive. The document produced by incrementally defined rules is\nthe union of the documents produced by each individual rule.\nFor example, we can write a rule that abstracts over our servers and\ncontainers data as instances:\ninstances[instance] {\n    sites[_].servers[_] = server\n    instance = {\"address\": server.hostname, \"name\": server.name}\n}\n\ninstances[instance] {\n    containers[_] = container,\n    instance = {\"address\": container.ipaddress, \"name\": container.name}\n}\n\nIf the head of the rule is same, we can chain multiple rule bodies together to\nobtain the same result:\ninstances[instance] {\n    sites[_].servers[_] = server\n    instance = {\"address\": server.hostname, \"name\": server.name}\n} {\n    containers[_] = container,\n    instance = {\"address\": container.ipaddress, \"name\": container.name}\n}\n\nAn incrementally defined rule can be intuitively understood as  OR  OR ... OR .\nThe result:\n> instances[x]\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n|                       x                       |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n| {\"address\":\"hydrogen\",\"name\":\"web-0\"}         |\n| {\"address\":\"helium\",\"name\":\"web-1\"}           |\n| {\"address\":\"lithium\",\"name\":\"db-0\"}           |\n| {\"address\":\"beryllium\",\"name\":\"web-1000\"}     |\n| {\"address\":\"boron\",\"name\":\"web-1001\"}         |\n| {\"address\":\"carbon\",\"name\":\"db-1000\"}         |\n| {\"address\":\"nitrogen\",\"name\":\"web-dev\"}       |\n| {\"address\":\"oxygen\",\"name\":\"db-dev\"}          |\n| {\"address\":\"10.0.0.1\",\"name\":\"big_stallman\"}  |\n| {\"address\":\"10.0.0.2\",\"name\":\"cranky_euclid\"} |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n\n Complete Definitions\nIn addition to rules that partially define sets and objects, Rego also\nsupports so-called complete definitions of any type of document. Rules provide\na complete definition by omitting the key in the head. Complete definitions are\ncommonly used for constants:\npi = 3.14159\n\n\nRego allows authors to omit the body of rules. If the body is omitted, it\ndefaults to true.\n\nDocuments produced by rules with complete definitions can only have one value at\na time. If evaluation produces multiple values for the same document, an error\nwill be returned.\nFor example:\n# Define user \"bob\" for test input.\nuser = \"bob\"\n\n# Define two sets of users: power users and restricted users. Accidentally\n# include \"bob\" in both.\npower_users = {\"alice\", \"bob\", \"fred\"}\nrestricted_users = {\"bob\", \"kim\"}\n\n# Power users get 32GB memory.\nmax_memory = 32 { power_users[user] }\n\n# Restricted users get 4GB memory.\nmax_memory = 4 { restricted_users[user] }\n\nError:\n> max_memory\nmax_memory: eval_conflict_error: completely defined rules must produce exactly one value\nOPA returns an error in this case because the rule definitions are in conflict. The value produced by max_memory cannot be 32 and 4 at the same time.\nThe documents produced by rules with complete definitions may still be undefined:\n> unset user\n> user = \"johnson\"  # user is not in either of the sets defined earlier.\n> max_memory\nundefined\n\nIn some cases, having an undefined result for a document is not desirable. In those cases, policies can use the Default Keyword to provide a fallback value.\n User Functions\nRego supports user defined functions that can be called with the same semantics as Built-in Functions. User functions do not need to be imported, and can be accessed by their name preceded by their package name. They have access to both the the data Document and the input Document.\nFor example, the following function will return the result of trimming the spaces from a string and then splitting it by periods.\n> trim_and_split(s) = x {\n|     trim(s, \" \", t)\n|     split(t, \".\", x)\n| }\n|\n> trim_and_split(\"   foo.bar \", out)\n+---------------+\n|      out      |\n+---------------+\n| [\"foo\",\"bar\"] |\n+---------------+\n\nIn general, functions may have an arbitrary number of inputs, but exactly one output. All function inputs must be either Scalars, Variables, Arrays or Objects. The contents of Arrays and Objects passed to functions also must obey this restriction, applied recursively.\nIt is worth noting that these restrictions only apply to the declared inputs of functions. When calling a function, any term that matches the declared terms may be passed. If the passed term has deeper components than the declared term, the deep parts will be folded into the appropriate variables in the declaration.\nAs an example, suppose we have the user defined function below:\nfoo([x, {\"bar\": y}]) = z {\n    z = {x: y}\n}\nThe following calls would produce the logical mappings given:\n\n\n\nCall\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\nfoo(a, z)\na[0]\na[1].bar\n\n\nfoo([\"5\", {\"bar\": \"hello\"}], z)\n\"5\"\n\"hello\"\n\n\nfoo([\"5\", {\"bar\": [1, 2, 3, [\"foo\", \"bar\"]]}], z)\n\"5\"\n[1, 2, 3, [\"foo\", \"bar\"]]\n\n\n\nIf you need multiple outputs, write your functions so that the output is an array, object or set containing your results. If the output term is omitted, it is equivalent to having the output term be the literal true. That is, the function declarations below are equivalent:\nf(x) {\n    x = \"foo\"\n}\n\nf(x) = true {\n    x = \"foo\"\n}\nThe outputs of user functions have some additional limitations, namely that they must resolve to a single value. If you write a function that has multiple possible bindings for an output variable, you will get a conflict error:\n> p(x) = y {\n|     x[_] = y\n| }\n|\n> p([1, 2, 3], out)\np([1, 2, 3], out): eval_conflict_error: function \"repl.p\" produces conflicting outputs\n\nIt is possible in Rego to define a function more than once, to achieve a conditional selection of which function to execute:\n> p(1, x) = y {\n|     y = x\n| }\n|\n> p(2, x) = y {\n|     y = x*4\n| }\n|\n> p(1, 2, y)\n+---+\n| y |\n+---+\n| 2 |\n+---+\n> p(2, 2, y)\n+---+\n| y |\n+---+\n| 8 |\n+---+\n\nA given function call will execute all functions that match the signature given. If a call matches multiple functions, they must produce the same output, or else a conflict error will occur:\n> p(1, x) = y {\n|     y = x\n| }\n|\n> p(x, 2) = y {\n|     y = x*4\n| }\n|\n> p(1, 2, y)\np(1, 2, y): eval_conflict_error: function \"repl.p\" produces conflicting outputs\n\nOn the other hand, if a call matches no functions, then the result is undefined, and the query containing it will become unsatisfied.\n> p(x, 2) = y {\n|     y = x*4\n| }\n|\n> p(5, 2, y)\n+----+\n| y  |\n+----+\n| 20 |\n+----+\n> p(5, 3, y)\nfalse\nFor a formal definition of the function syntax (as well as formal definitions for Array, Object and Scalar), see the Language Reference document.\n Negation\nTo generate the content of a Virtual Document, OPA attempts to bind variables in the body of the rule such that all expressions in the rule evaluate to True.\nThis generates the correct result when the expressions represent assertions about what states should exist in the data stored in OPA. In some cases, you want to express that certain states should not exist in the data stored in OPA. In these cases, negation must be used.\nFor safety, a variable appearing in a negated expression must also appear in another non-negated equality expression in the rule.\n\nOPA will reorder expressions to ensure that negated expressions are evaluated after other non-negated expressions with the same variables. OPA will reject rules containing negated expressions that do not meet the safety criteria described above.\n\nThe simplest use of negation involves only scalar values or variables and is equivalent to complementing the operator:\nt {\n    greeting = \"hello\"\n    not greeting = \"goodbye\"\n}\n\nThe result:\n> t\ntrue\n\nNegation is required to check whether some value does not exist in a collection. That is, complementing the operator in an expression such as p[_] = \"foo\" yields p[_] != \"foo\". However, this is not equivalent to not p[\"foo\"].\nFor example, we can write a rule that defines a document containing names of apps not deployed on the \"prod\" site:\nprod_servers[name] {\n    sites[_] = site\n    site.name = \"prod\"\n    site.servers[_].name = name\n}\n\napps_in_prod[name] {\n    apps[_] = app\n    app.servers[_] = server\n    app.name = name\n    prod_servers[server]\n}\n\napps_not_in_prod[name] {\n    apps[_].name = name\n    not apps_in_prod[name]\n}\n\nThe result:\n> apps_not_in_prod[name]\n+-----------+\n|   name    |\n+-----------+\n| \"mongodb\" |\n+-----------+\n\n Modules\nIn Rego, policies are defined inside modules. Modules consist of:\n\nExactly one Package declaration.\nZero or more Import statements.\nZero or more Rule definitions.\n\nModules are typically represented in Unicode text and encoded in UTF-8.\n Comments\nComments begin with the # character and continue until the end of the line.\n Packages\nPackages group the rules defined in one or more modules into a particular namespace. Because rules are namespaced they can be safely shared across projects.\nModules contributing to the same package do not have to be located in the same directory.\nThe rules defined in a module are automatically exported. That is, they can be queried under OPA’s Data API provided the appropriate package is given. For example, given the following module:\npackage opa.examples\n\npi = 3.14159\n\nThe pi document can be queried via the Data API:\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/opa/examples/pi HTTP/1.1\n\n Imports\nImport statements declare dependencies that modules have on documents defined outside the package. By importing a document, the identifiers exported by that document can be referenced within the current module.\nAll modules contain implicit statements which import the data and input documents.\nModules use the same syntax to declare dependencies on Base Documents and Virtual Documents.\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport data.servers\n\nhttp_servers[server] {\n    server = servers[_]\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n}\n\nSimilarly, modules can declare dependencies on query arguments by specifying an import path that starts with input.\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport input.user\nimport input.method\n\n# allow alice to perform any operation.\nallow { user = \"alice\" }\n\n# allow bob to perform read-only operations.\nallow {\n    user = \"bob\"\n    method = \"GET\"\n}\n\nImports can include an optional as keyword to handle namespacing issues:\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport data.servers as my_servers\n\nhttp_servers[server] {\n    server = my_servers[_]\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n}\n\n With Keyword\nThe with keyword allows queries to programmatically specify values nested\nunder The input Document.\nFor example, given the simple authorization policy in the Imports\nsection, we can write a query that checks whether a particular request would be\nallowed:\n> import data.opa.examples.allow\n> allow with input as {\"user\": \"alice\", \"method\": \"POST\"}\ntrue\n> allow with input as {\"user\": \"bob\", \"method\": \"GET\"}\ntrue\n> not allow with input as {\"user\": \"bob\", \"method\": \"DELETE\"}\ntrue\n\nThe with keyword acts as a modifier on expressions. A single expression is\nallowed to have zero or more with modifiers. The with keyword has the\nfollowing syntax:\n with  as  [with  as  [...]]\nThe s must be references to values in the input document (or the input\ndocument itself). The s may be Scalar Values, Variables, or Composite\nValues that do not contain References or Comprehensions.\n Default Keyword\nThe default keyword allows policies to define a default value for documents\nproduced by rules with Complete Definitions. The\ndefault value is used when all of the rules sharing the same name are undefined.\nFor example:\ndefault allow = false\n\nallow {\n    input.user = \"bob\"\n    input.method = \"GET\"\n}\n\nallow {\n    input.user = \"alice\"\n}\n\nWhen the allow document is queried, the return value will be either true or false.\n> allow with input.user as \"bob\" with input.method as \"POST\"\nfalse\n\nWithout the default definition, the allow document would simply be undefined for the same input.\nWhen the default keyword is used, the rule syntax is restricted to:\ndefault  = \nThe term may be any scalar, composite, or comprehension value but it may not be\na variable or reference. If the value is a composite then it may not contain\nvariables or references.\n Else Keyword\nThe else  keyword is a basic control flow construct that gives you control\nover rule evaluation order.\nRules grouped together with the else keyword are evaluated until a match is\nfound. Once a match is found, rule evaluation does not proceed to rules further\nin the chain.\nThe else keyword is useful if you are porting policies into Rego from an\norder-sensitive system like IPTables.\n# Service queries \"authorize\" and intreprets result (\"allow\" or \"deny\")\nauthorize = \"allow\" {\n    input.user = \"superuser\"\n}\n\n# Check if caller is from outside network.\nelse = \"deny\" {\n    input.path[0] = \"admin\"\n    input.source_network = \"external\"\n}\n\n# Check if caller is from inside network.\nelse = \"allow\" {\n    input.path[0] = \"admin\"\n    input.source_network = \"internal\"\n} # ... more rules\n Operators\n Equality\nThe equality operator (=) is used to define expressions that assert that two values are the same. If the expression is defined in terms of one or more variables then the expression will evaluate to true if one of the variables is unbound. If the neither operand is an unbound variable, the expression is evaluated by comparing the values referenced by the operands.\nOPA attempts to bind variables to values when it encounters unbound variables in equality expressions. Binding a variable affects subsequent evaluation of expressions such that the variable will be treated as a constant (with the bound value) instead of a variable.\n Inequality\nThe following inequality operators are supported:\na  !=  b  #  `a` is not equal to `b`.\na     b  #  `a` is greater than `b`.\na  >=  b  #  `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.\n\nUnlike the equality operator, these operators do not bind variables contained in the expression. As a result, if either operand is a variable, the variable must appear in another expression in the same rule that would cause the variable to be bound, i.e., an equality expression or the target position of a built-in function.\n Built-in Functions\nIn some cases, rules must perform simple arithmetic, aggregation, and so on.\nRego provides a number of built-in functions (or “built-ins”) for performing\nthese tasks.\nBuilt-ins can be easily recognized by their syntax. All built-ins have the\nfollowing form:\n(, , ..., )\nBuilt-ins usually take one or more input values and produce at least one output\nvalue. Unless stated otherwise, all built-ins accept values or variables as\noutput arguments.\nBuilt-ins can include \".\" characters in the name. This allows them to be\nnamespaced.

bad request\n500 - server error\n\nBefore accepting the request, the server will parse, compile, and install the policy module. If the policy module is invalid, one of these steps will fail and the server will respond with 400. The error message in the response will be set to indicate the source of the error.\nDelete a Policy\nDELETE /v1/policies/\nDelete a policy module.\nExample Request\nDELETE /v1/policies/example2 HTTP/1.1\n\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\nStatus Codes\n\n204 - no content\n400 - bad request\n404 - not found\n500 - server error\n\nIf other policy modules in the same package depend on rules in the policy module to be deleted, the server will return 400.\n Data API\nThe Data API exposes endpoints for reading and writing documents in OPA. For an introduction to the different types of documents in OPA see How Does OPA Work?.\nGet a Document\nGET /v1/data/{path:.+}\nGet a document.\nThe path separator is used to access values inside object and array documents. If the path indexes into an array, the server will attempt to convert the array index to an integer. If the path element cannot be converted to an integer, the server will respond with 404.\nExample Request\nGET /v1/data/opa/examples/public_servers HTTP/1.1\n\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 200

Format is [[]:] where  is the import path of the input document. The parameter may be specified multiple times but each instance should specify a unique . The  may be empty (in which case, the entire input will be set to the ). The  may be a reference to a document in OPA. If  contains variables the response will contain a set of results instead of a single document. In most cases, input should be provided using the POST method, see Get a Document (with Input).\npretty - If parameter is true, response will formatted for humans.\nexplain - Return query explanation in addition to result. Values: full, truth.\nmetrics - Return query performance metrics in addition to result. See Performance Metrics for more detail.\n\nStatus Codes\n\n200 - no error\n400 - bad request\n500 - server error\n\nThe server returns 400 if either:\n\nThe query requires the input document and the caller does not provide it.\nThe caller provides the input document but the query already defines it programmatically.\n\nThe server returns 200 if the path refers to an undefined document. In this\ncase, the response will not contain a result property.\n Get a Document (with Input)\nPOST /v1/data/{path:.+}\nContent-Type: application/json\n{\n  \"input\": ...\n}\n\nGet a document that requires input.\nThe path separator is used to access values inside object and array documents. If the path indexes into an array, the server will attempt to convert the array index to an integer. If the path element cannot be converted to an integer, the server will respond with 404.\nThe request body contains an object that specifies a value for The input Document.\nThe examples below assume the following policy:\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport input.example.flag\n\nallow_request { flag = true }\n\nExample Request\nPOST /v1/data/opa/examples/allow_request HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"input\": {\n    \"example\": {\n      \"flag\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"result\": true\n}\n\nExample Request\nPOST /v1/data/opa/examples/allow_request HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"input\": {\n    \"example\": {\n      \"flag\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n{}\n\nQuery Parameters\n\npretty - If parameter is true, response will formatted for humans.\nexplain - Return query explanation in addition to result. Values: full, truth.\nmetrics - Return query performance metrics in addition to result. See Performance Metrics for more detail.\n\nStatus Codes\n\n200 - no error\n400 - bad request\n500 - server error\n\nThe server returns 400 if either:\n\nThe query requires an input document and the client did not supply one.\nThe query already defines an input document and the client did supply one.\n\nThe server returns 200 if the path refers to an undefined document. In this\ncase, the response will not contain a result property.\nGet a Document (Webhook)\nPOST /v0/data/{path:.+}\nContent-Type: application/json\nGet a document from a webhook.\nUse this API if you are enforcing policy decisions via webhooks that have pre-defined\nrequest/response formats. Note, the API path prefix is /v0 instead of /v1.\nThe request message body defines the content of the The input\nDocument. The request message body\nmay be empty. The path separator is used to access values inside object and\narray documents.\nThe examples below assume the following policy:\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport input.example.flag\n\nallow_request { flag = true }\n\nExample Request\nPOST /v0/data/opa/examples/allow_request HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"example\": {\n    \"flag\": true\n  }\n}\n\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\ntrue\n\nQuery Parameters\n\npretty - If parameter is true, response will formatted for humans.\n\nStatus Codes\n\n200 - no error\n400 - bad request\n404 - not found\n500 - server error\n\nIf the requested document is missing or undefined, the server will return 404 and the message body will contain an error object.\nCreate or Overwrite a Document\nPUT /v1/data/{path:.+}\nContent-Type: application/json\nCreate or overwrite a document.\nIf the path does not refer to an existing document, the server will attempt to create all of the necessary containing documents. This behavior is similar in principle to the Unix command mkdir -p.\nThe server will respect the If-None-Match header if it is set to *. In this case, the server will not overwrite an existing document located at the path.\nExample Request To Initialize Document With If-None-Match\nPUT /v1/data/us-west/servers HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\nIf-None-Match: *\n\n{}\n\nExample Response If Document Already Exists\nHTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\n\nExample Response If Document Does Not Exist\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\nStatus Codes\n\n204 - no content (success)\n304 - not modified\n404 - write conflict\n\nIf the path refers to a virtual document or a conflicting base document the server will respond with 404. A base document conflict will occur if the parent portion of the path refers to a non-object document.\nPatch a Document\nPATCH /v1/data/{path:.+}\nContent-Type: application/json-patch+json\nUpdate a document.\nThe path separator is used to access values inside object and array documents. If the path indexes into an array, the server will attempt to convert the array index to an integer. If the path element cannot be converted to an integer, the server will respond with 404.\nThe server accepts updates encoded as JSON Patch operations. The message body of the request should contain a JSON encoded array containing one or more JSON Patch operations. Each operation specifies the operation type, path, and an optional value. For more information on JSON Patch, see RFC 6902.\nExample Request\nPATCH /v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json-patch+json\n\n[\n    {\"op\": \"add\",\n     \"path\": \"-\",\n     \"value\": {\n         \"id\": \"s5\",\n         \"name\": \"job\",\n         \"protocols\": [\"amqp\"],\n         \"ports\": [\"p3\"]\n     }}\n]\n\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\nStatus Codes\n\n204 - no content (success)\n404 - not found\n500 - server error\n\nThe effective path of the JSON Patch operation is obtained by joining the path portion of the URL with the path value from the operation(s) contained in the message body. In all cases, the parent of the effective path MUST refer to an existing document, otherwise the server returns 404. In the case of remove and replace operations, the effective path MUST refer to an existing document, otherwise the server returns 404.\n Query API\nExecute a Query\nGET /v1/query\nExecute an ad-hoc query and return bindings for variables found in the query.\nExample Request\nGET /v1/query?q=data.servers[i].ports[_] = \"p2\"; data.servers[i].name = name HTTP/1.1\nExample Response\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"i\": 3,\n      \"name\": \"dev\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"i\": 0,\n      \"name\": \"app\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nQuery Parameters\n\nq - The ad-hoc query to execute. OPA will parse, compile, and execute the query represented by the parameter value. The value MUST be URL encoded.\npretty - If parameter is true, response will formatted for humans.\nexplain - Return query explanation in addition to result. Values: full, truth.\nmetrics - Return query performance metrics in addition to result. See Performance Metrics for more detail.\n\nStatus Codes\n\n200 - no error\n400 - bad request\n500 - server error\n\n Authentication\nThe API is secured via HTTPS, Authentication, and\nAuthorization.\n Bearer Tokens\nWhen OPA is started with the --authentication=token command line flag,\nclients MUST provide a Bearer token in the HTTP Authorization header:\nGET /v1/data/exempli-gratia HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer my-secret-token\n\nBearer tokens must be represented with a valid HTTP header value character\nsequence.\nOPA will extract the Bearer token value (which is set to my-secret-token\nabove) and provide it to the authorization component inside OPA that will (i)\nvalidate the token and (ii) execute the authorization policy configured by the\nadmin.\n Errors\nAll of the API endpoints use standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or\nfailure of an API call. If an API call fails, the response will contain a JSON\nencoded object that provides more detail. The errors and location fields are\noptional:\n{\n  \"code\": \"invalid_parameter\",\n  \"message\": \"error(s) occurred while compiling module(s)\",\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"code\": \"rego_unsafe_var_error\",\n      \"message\": \"var x is unsafe\",\n      \"location\": {\n        \"file\": \"example\",\n        \"row\": 3,\n        \"col\": 1\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n Explanations\nOPA supports query explanations that describe (in detail) the steps taken to\nproduce query results.\nExplanations can be requested for:\n\nData API GET queries\nQuery API queries\n\nExplanations are requested by setting the explain query parameter to one of\nthe following values:\n\nfull - returns a full query trace containing every step in the query evaluation process.\ntruth - returns a partial query trace containing one path that leads to the overall query being successful.\n\nTrace Events\nWhen the explain query parameter is set to full or truth , the\nresponse contains an array of Trace Event objects.\nTrace Event objects contain the following fields:\n\nop - identifies the kind of Trace Event. Values: \"Enter\", \"Exit\", \"Eval\", \"Fail\", \"Redo\".\nquery_id - uniquely identifies the query that the Trace Event was emitted for.\nparent_id - identifies the parent query.\ntype - indicates the type of the node field. Values: \"expr\", \"rule\", \"body\".\nnode - contains the AST element associated with the evaluation step.\nlocals - contains the term bindings from the query at the time when the Trace Event was emitted.\n\nQuery IDs\nQueries often reference rules or contain comprehensions. In both cases, query\nevaluation involves evaluation of one or more other queries, e.g., the body of\nthe rule or comprehension.\nTrace Events from different queries can be distinguished by the query_id\nfield.\nTrace Events from related queries can be identified by the parent_id field.\nFor example, if query A references a rule R, Trace Events emitted as part of\nevaluating rule R's body will have the parent_id field set to query A's\nquery_id.\nTypes of Events\nEach Trace Event represents a step in the query evaluation process. Trace Events\nare emitted at the following points:\n\nenter - before a body or rule is evaluated.\nexit - after a body or rule has evaluated successfully.\neval - before an expression is evaluated.\nfail - after an expression has evaluated to false.\nredo - before evaluation restarts from a body, rule, or expression.\n\nBy default, OPA searches for all sets of term bindings that make all expressions\nin the query evaluate to true. Because there may be multiple answers, the search\ncan restart when OPA determines the query is true or false. When the search\nrestarts, a Redo Trace Event is emitted.\nExample Trace Event\n{\n  \"op\": \"eval\",\n  \"query_id\": 20,\n  \"parent_id\": 0,\n  \"type\": \"expr\",\n  \"node\": {\n    \"index\": 1,\n    \"terms\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"eq\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"x\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"y\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"locals\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"x\"\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"value\": \"hello\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n Performance Metrics\nOPA can report detailed performance metrics at runtime. Currently, performance metrics can be requested on individual API calls and are returned inline with the API response. To enable performance metric collection on an API call, specify the metrics=true query parameter when executing the API call. Performance metrics are currently supported for the following APIs:\n\nData API GET\nData API POST\nQuery API\n\nFor example:\nPOST /v1/data/example?metrics=true HTTP/1.1\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"timer_rego_query_compile_ns\": 69994,\n    \"timer_rego_query_eval_ns\": 48425,\n    \"timer_rego_query_parse_ns\": 4096\n  },\n  \"result\": {\n    \"some_strings\": [\n      \"hello\",\n      \"world\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nOPA currently supports the following query performance metrics:\n\ntimer_rego_query_parse_ns: time taken (in nanonseconds) to parse the query.\ntimer_rego_query_compile_ns: time taken (in nanonseconds) to compile the query.\ntimer_rego_query_eval_ns: time taken (in nanonseconds) to evaluate the query.\n\n"},"deployments.html":{"url":"deployments.html","title":"Deployments","keywords":"","body":"Deployments\nThis document helps you get OPA up and running in different deployment\nenvironments. You should read this document if you are planning to deploy OPA.\nDocker\nDocker makes OPA easy to deploy in different types of environments.\nThis section explains how to use the official OPA Docker images. If this is your\nfirst time deploying OPA and you plan to use one of the Docker images, we\nrecommend you review this section to familiarize yourself with the basics.\nOPA releases are available as images on Docker Hub.\n\nopenpolicyagent/opa:0.5.0\n\nRunning with Docker\nIf you start OPA outside of Docker without any arguments, it prints a list of\navailable commands. By default, the official OPA Docker image executes the run\ncommand which starts an instance of OPA as an interactive shell. This is nice\nfor development, however, for deployments, we want to run OPA as a server.\nThe run command accepts a --server (or -s) flag that starts OPA as a\nserver. See --help for more information on other arguments. The most important\ncommand line arguments for OPA's server mode are:\n\n--addr to set the listening address (default: 0.0.0.0:8181).\n--log-level (or -l) to set the log level (default: \"info\").\n--log-format to set the log format (default: \"text\").\n\nBy default, OPA listens for normal HTTP connections on 0.0.0.0:8181. To make\nOPA listen for HTTPS connections, see Security.\nWe can run OPA as a server using Docker:\ndocker run -p 8181:8181 openpolicyagent/opa \\\n    run --server --log-level debug\n\nTest that OPA is available:\ncurl -i localhost:8181/\nLogging\nOPA logs to stderr and the level can be set with --log-level/-l. The default log level is info which causes OPA to log request/response headers.\ntime=\"2017-03-12T03:03:23Z\" level=info msg=\"First line of log stream.\" addr=\":8181\"\ntime=\"2017-03-12T03:03:30Z\" level=debug msg=\"Received request.\" client_addr=\"172.17.0.1:60952\" req_body= req_id=1 req_method=GET req_params=map[] req_path=\"/v1/data\"\ntime=\"2017-03-12T03:03:30Z\" level=debug msg=\"Sent response.\" client_addr=\"172.17.0.1:60952\" req_id=1 req_method=GET req_path=\"/v1/data\" resp_bytes=13 resp_duration=0.402793 resp_status=200\nIf the log level is set to debug the request and response message bodies will be logged.

When running inside Docker, you can\nprovide files via volume mounts.\ndocker run -v $PWD/example:/example openpolicyagent/opa \\\n    run -e 'data.example.greeting' \\\n    /example\n\n$PWD/example/data.json:\n{\n    \"hostOS\": \"$(uname)\"\n}\n\n$PWD/example/policy.rego:\npackage example\n\ngreeting = msg {\n    concat(\"\", [\"Hello \", data.example.hostOS, \"!\"], msg)\n}\n\nMore Information\nFor more information on OPA's command line, see --help:\ndocker run openpolicyagent/opa run --help\nTagging\nThe Docker Hub repository contains tags for every release of OPA. For more\ninformation on each release see the GitHub\nReleases page.\nThe \"latest\" tag refers to the most recent release. The latest tag is convenient\nif you want to quickly try out OPA however for production deployments, we\nrecommend using an explicit version tag.\nDevelopment builds are also available on Docker Hub. For each version the\n{version}-dev tag refers the most recent development build for that version.\nThe version information is contained in the OPA executable itself. You can check\nthe version with the following command:\ndocker run openpolicyagent/opa version\n\nKubernetes\nKicking the Tires\nThis section shows how to quickly deploy OPA on top of Kubernetes to try it out.\n\nThese steps assume Kubernetes is deployed with\nminikube. If you are using a different\nKubernetes provider, the steps should be similar. You may need to use a\ndifferent Service configuration at the end.\n\nFirst, create a ConfigMap containing a test policy. The policy will inspect\n\"pod\" objects provided as input. If the pod is missing a \"customer\" label or the\npod includes containers that refer to images outside the acmecorp registry,\n\"allow\" will be false.\nIn this case, the policy file does not contain sensitive information so it's\nfine to store as a ConfigMap. If the file contained sensitive information, then\nwe recommend you store it as a Secret.\npackage example\n\nimport input.pod\n\ndefault allow = true\n\nallow = false {\n    not pod.metadata.labels.customer\n}\n\nallow = false {\n    container = pod.spec.containers[_]\n    not re_match(\"^registry.acmecorp.com/.+$\", container.image)\n}\n\nkubectl create configmap example-policy \\\n    --from-file example.rego\n\nNext, create a ReplicationController to deploy OPA. The ConfigMap containing the\npolicy is volume mounted into the container. This allows OPA to load the policy\nfrom the file system.\nkind: ReplicationController\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: opa\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    app: opa\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: opa\n    spec:\n      volumes:\n      - name: example-policy\n        configMap:\n          name: example-policy\n      containers:\n      - name: opa\n        image: openpolicyagent/opa\n        ports:\n        - name: http\n          containerPort: 8181\n        args:\n        - \"run\"\n        - \"--server\"\n        - \"/policies/example.rego\"\n        volumeMounts:\n        - readOnly: true\n          mountPath: /policies\n          name: example-policy\n\nkubectl create -f rc_opa.yaml\n\nAt this point OPA is up and running. Create a Service to expose the OPA API so\nthat you can query it:\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: opa\n  labels:\n    app: opa\nspec:\n  type: NodePort\n  selector:\n    app: opa\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      protocol: TCP\n      port: 8181\n      targetPort: 8181\n\nkubectl create -f svc_opa.yaml\n\nGet the URL of OPA using minikube:\nOPA_URL=$(minikube service opa --url)\n\nExercise the OPA API. Note that the container below references an image outside\nour hypothetical repository:\n{\n    \"input\": {\n        \"kind\": \"Pod\",\n        \"apiVersion\": \"v1\",\n        \"metadata\": {\n            \"name\": \"opa\",\n            \"labels\": {\n                \"customer\": \"example.org\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"spec\": {\n            \"containers\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"opa\",\n                    \"image\": \"openpolicyagent/opa\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ncurl $OPA_URL/v1/data -d @example_pod.json\n\n"},"security.html":{"url":"security.html","title":"Security","keywords":"","body":"Security\nThis document provides guidelines for deploying OPA inside untrusted\nenvironments. You should read this document if you are deploying OPA as a\nservice.\nSecuring the API involves configuring OPA to use TLS, authentication, and\nauthorization so that:\n\nTraffic between OPA and clients is encrypted.\nClients verify the OPA API endpoint identity.\nOPA verifies client identities.\nClients are only granted access to specific APIs or sections of The data Document.\n\nTLS & HTTPS\nHTTPS is configured by specifying TLS credentials via command line flags at\nstartup:\n\n--tls-cert-file= specifies the path of the file containing the TLS certificate.\n--tls-private-key-file= specifies the path of the file containing the TLS private key.\n\nOPA will exit immediately with a non-zero status code if only one of these flags\nis specified.\nBy default, OPA ignores insecure HTTP connections when TLS is enabled. To allow\ninsecure HTTP connections in addition to HTTPS connections, provide another\nlistening address with --insecure-addr.\n1.

Client-side authentication of the OPA API endpoint should be handled\nwith TLS.\nAuthentication and authorization allow OPA to:\n\nVerify client identities.\nControl client access to APIs and data.\n\nBoth are configured via command line flags:\n\n--authentication= specifies the authentication scheme to use.\n--authorization= specifies the authorization scheme to use.\n\nBy default, OPA does not perform authentication or authorization and these flags\ndefault to off.\nFor authentication, OPA supports:\n\nBearer tokens: Bearer tokens are enabled by starting OPA with --authentication=token.\n\nFor authorization, OPA relies on policy written in Rego. Authorization is\nenabled by starting OPA with --authorization=basic.\nWhen the basic authorization scheme is enabled, a minimal authorization policy\nmust be provided on startup. The authorization policy must be structured as follows:\n# The \"system\" namespace is reserved for internal use\n# by OPA. Authorization policy must be defined under\n# system.authz as follows:\npackage system.authz\n\ndefault allow = false  # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {\n  # Logic to authorize request goes here.\n}\n\nWhen OPA receives a request, it executes a query against the document defined\ndata.system.authz.allow. The implementation of the policy may span multiple\npackages however it is recommended that administrators keep the policy under the\nsystem namespace.\nIf the document produced by the allow rule is true, the request is\nprocessed normally. If the document is undefined or not true, the\nrequest is rejected immediately.\nOPA provides the following input document when executing the authorization\npolicy:\n{\n    \"input\": {\n        # Identity established by authentication scheme.\n        # When Bearer tokens are used, the identity is\n        # set to the Bearer token value.\n        \"identity\": ,\n\n        # One of {GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE}.\n        \"method\": ,\n\n        # URL path represented as an array.\n        # For example: /v1/data/exempli-gratia\n        # is represented as [v1, data, exampli-gratia]\n        \"path\": ,\n    }\n}\n\nAt a minimum, the authorization policy should grant access to a special root\nidentity:\npackage system.authz\n\ndefault allow = false          # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {                        # Allow request if...\n    \"secret\" = input.identity  # Identity is the secret root key.\n}\n\nWhen OPA is configured with this minimal authorization policy, requests without\nauthentication are rejected:\nGET /v1/policies HTTP/1.1\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"code\": \"unauthorized\",\n  \"message\": \"request rejected by administrative policy\"\n}\n\nHowever, if Bearer token authentication is enabled and the request includes the\nsecret from above, the request is allowed:\nGET /v1/policies HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer secret\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nWhen Bearer tokens are used for authentication, the policy should at minimum\nvalidate the identity:\npackage system.authz\n\n# Tokens may defined in policy or pushed into OPA as data.\ntokens = {\n    \"my-secret-token-foo\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"admin\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-bar\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-1\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-baz\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-2\", \"service-3\"]\n    }\n}\n\ndefault allow = false          # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {                        # Allow request if...\n    input.identity = \"secret\"  # Identity is the secret root key.\n}\n\nallow {                        # Allow request if...\n    tokens[input.identity]     # Identity exists in \"tokens\".\n}\n\nTo complete this example, the policy could further restrict tokens to specific\ndocuments:\npackage system.authz\n\n# Rights may be defined in policy or pushed into OPA as data.\nrights = {\n    \"admin\": {\n        \"path\": \"*\"\n    },\n    \"service-1\": {\n        \"path\": [\"v1\", \"data\", \"exempli\", \"gratia\"]\n    },\n    \"service-2\": {\n        \"path\": [\"v1\", \"data\", \"par\", \"example\"]\n    }\n}\n\n# Tokens may be defined in policy or pushed into OPA as data.\ntokens = {\n    \"my-secret-token-foo\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"admin\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-bar\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-1\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-baz\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-2\", \"service-3\"]\n    }\n}\n\ndefault allow = false               # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {                             # Allow request if...\n    identity_rights[right]          # Rights for identity exist, and...\n    right.path = \"*\"                # Right.path is '*'.\n} {                                 # Or...\n    identity_rights[right]          # Rights for identity exist, and...\n    right.path = input.path         # Right.path matches input.path.\n}\n\nidentity_rights[right] {            # Right is in the identity_rights set if...\n    token = tokens[input.identity]  # Token exists for identity, and...\n    role = token.roles[_]           # Token has a role, and...\n    right = rights[role]            # Role has rights defined.\n}\n\n"},"get-started.html":{"url":"get-started.html","title":"Get Started","keywords":"","body":"Get Started\nThe Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack.\nOPA provides a high-level declarative language for authoring policies and\nsimple APIs to answer policy queries. Using OPA, you can offload policy\ndecisions from your service such as:\n\nShould this API call be allowed? E.g., true or false.\nHow much quota remains for this user? E.g., 1048.\nWhich hosts can this container be deployed on? E.g., [\"host1\", \"host40\", ..., \"host329\"].\nWhat updates must be applied to this resource? E.g., {\"labels\": {\"team\": \"products}}.\n\nThis tutorial shows how to get started with OPA using an interactive shell or REPL (read-eval-print loop).\nGoals\nREPLs are great for learning new languages and running quick experiments. You\ncan use OPA's REPL to experiment with policies and prototype new ones.\nTo introduce the REPL, you will use dummy data and an example policy. In English, the policy can be stated as follows:\n\nServers that open an unencrypted HTTP port must not be connected to a public network.\n\nInside the REPL, you will define rules that codify the policy stated above.\nOnce you finish this tutorial, you will be familiar with:\n\nRunning OPA as an interactive shell/REPL.\nWriting ad-hoc queries in Rego.\n\nPrerequisites\nIf this is your first time using OPA, download the latest executable for your system.\nOn macOS (64-bit):\ncurl -L -o opa https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/download/v0.5.0/opa_darwin_amd64\n\nOn Linux (64-bit):\ncurl -L -o opa https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/download/v0.5.0/opa_linux_amd64\n\nSet permissions on the OPA executable:\nchmod 755 ./opa\n\nSteps\n1. Make sure you can run the REPL on your machine.\n./opa run\n\nWithout any data, you can experiment with simple expressions to get the hang of it:\n> true\ntrue\n> 3.14\n3.14\n> [\"hello\", \"world\"]\n[\n  \"hello\",\n  \"world\"\n]\n\nYou can also test simple boolean expressions:\n> true = false\nfalse\n> 3.14 > 3\ntrue\n> \"hello\" != \"goodbye\"\ntrue\n\nMost REPLs let you define variables that you can reference later on. OPA allows you to do something similar. For example, you can define a pi constant as follows:\n> pi = 3.14\n\nOnce \"pi\" is defined, you query for the value and write expressions in terms of it:\n> pi\n3.14\n> pi > 3\ntrue\n\nOne thing to watch out for in the REPL is that = is used both for assigning variables values and for testing the value of variables. For example p = q sometimes assigns p the value of q and sometimes checks if the values of p and q are the same. The REPL decides between assignment and test based on whether p already has a value or not. If p has a value, p = q is a test (returning true or false), and if p has no value p = q is an assignment. To unset a value for a variable, use the unset command. (This ambiguity is only really an issue in the REPL. When writing policy, the duality of = is actually beneficial.)\n> pi = 3\nfalse\n> unset pi\n> pi = 3\n> pi\n3\n\nIn addition to running queries, the REPL also lets you define rules:\n> p[x] { a = [1,2,3,4]; a[x] }\n> p[x] > 1\n+---+\n| x |\n+---+\n| 2 |\n| 3 |\n+---+\n\nThe rule above defines a set of values that are the indices of elements in the array a.\nWhen you enter expressions into the OPA REPL, you are effectively running queries. The REPL output shows the values of variables in the expression that make the query true. If there is no set of variables that would make the query true, the REPL prints false. If there are no variables in the query and the query evaluates successfully, then the REPL just prints true.\nQuit out of the REPL by pressing Control-D or typing exit:\n> exit\nExiting\n\n2. Create a data file and a policy module.\nLet's define a bit of JSON data that will be used in the tutorial:\ncat >data.json \nAlso, let's include a rule that defines a set of servers that are attached to public networks:\ncat >example.rego \n3. Run the REPL with the data file and policy module as input.\n./opa run data.json example.rego\n\nYou can now run queries against the various documents:\n> data.servers[_].id\n+--------------------+\n| data.servers[_].id |\n+--------------------+\n| \"s1\"               |\n| \"s2\"               |\n| \"s3\"               |\n| \"s4\"               |\n+--------------------+\n> data.opa.example.public_servers[x]\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                       x                                       |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| {\"id\":\"s1\",\"name\":\"app\",\"ports\":[\"p1\",\"p2\",\"p3\"],\"protocols\":[\"https\",\"ssh\"]} |\n| {\"id\":\"s4\",\"name\":\"dev\",\"ports\":[\"p1\",\"p2\"],\"protocols\":[\"http\"]}             |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nOne powerful thing about Rego and the REPL is that you can run queries using the same syntax that you would use to lookup values.\nFor example if i has value 0 then data.servers[i] returns the first value in the data.servers array:\n> i = 0\n> data.servers[i]\n{\n  \"id\": \"s1\",\n  \"name\": \"app\",\n  \"ports\": [\n      \"p1\",\n      \"p2\",\n      \"p3\"\n  ],\n  \"protocols\": [\n      \"https\",\n      \"ssh\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThat same expression data.servers[i] when i has no value defines a query that returns all the values of i and data.servers[i]:\n> unset i\n> data.servers[i]\n+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| i |                                data.servers[i]                                |\n+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 0 | {\"id\":\"s1\",\"name\":\"app\",\"ports\":[\"p1\",\"p2\",\"p3\"],\"protocols\":[\"https\",\"ssh\"]} |\n| 1 | {\"id\":\"s2\",\"name\":\"db\",\"ports\":[\"p3\"],\"protocols\":[\"mysql\"]}                  |\n| 2 | {\"id\":\"s3\",\"name\":\"cache\",\"ports\":[\"p3\"],\"protocols\":[\"memcache\"]}            |\n| 3 | {\"id\":\"s4\",\"name\":\"dev\",\"ports\":[\"p1\",\"p2\"],\"protocols\":[\"http\"]}             |\n+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n4.

But many users require finer-grained access control and Docker’s plugin infrastructure allows us to do so.\nThis is an excellent opportunity to see how to policy enable an existing service.\nGoals\nThis tutorial helps you get started with OPA and introduces you to core concepts in OPA, including Rego the language used to define policies.\n\nPolicy enabling an application decouples the policy implementation from the business logic so that administrators can define policy without changing the application while still keeping up with the size, complexity, and dynamic nature of modern applications.\n\nAlthough there are a multitude of desirable access control policies, for demonstration purposes, we want to prevent the following:\n\nContainers with insecure configurations.\nUsers modifying the system without sufficient read+write access.\n\nThis tutorial illustrates two key concepts:\n\nOPA policy definition is decoupled from the implementation of the service (in this case Docker). The administrator is empowered to define and manage policies without requiring changes to any of the apps.\nBoth the data relevant to policy and the policy definitions themselves can change rapidly.\n\nOnce you finish this tutorial, you will be familiar with:\n\nRunning OPA as a server/daemon.\nLoading policy definitions and data via the REST APIs.\nQuerying data via the REST APIs.\nThe basics of Rego, OPA’s purpose-built policy language.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires:\n\nDocker Engine 1.11 or newer\nroot or sudo access\n\nThe tutorial has been tested on the following platforms:\n\nUbuntu 16.04 (64-bit)\n\nIf you are using a different distro, OS, or architecture, the steps will be the same. However, there may be slight differences in the commands you need to run.\nSteps\n1. Create a directory for OPA policy defintions.\n$ mkdir -p policies\n\n2. Download the latest version of OPA.\n$ curl -L https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/download/v0.5.0/opa_linux_amd64 > opa\n$ chmod u+x opa\n\n3. Run OPA in server mode with debug logging enabled.\n$ ./opa run --server --log-level debug\n\nOPA will run until it receives a signal to stop. Open another terminal to continue with the rest of the tutorial.\n4. Download the open-policy-agent/opa-docker-authz executable.\n$ curl -L https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa-docker-authz/releases/download/v0.1.5/opa-docker-authz_linux_amd64 > opa-docker-authz\n$ chmod u+x opa-docker-authz\n\nThe open-policy-agent/opa-docker-authz repository hosts a small Docker Authorization Plugin. Docker's authorization plugin system allows an external process to receive all requests sent to the Docker daemon. The authorization plugin replies, instructing the Docker daemon to allow or reject the request.\n5. Create an empty policy definition that will allow all requests.\n$ cat >example.rego \nThis policy definition is about simple as it can be. It includes a single rule named allow_request that is defined to always be true. Once all of the components are running, we will come back and extend this policy.\n6. Run the opa-docker-authz plugin and then open another terminal.\n$ sudo ./opa-docker-authz -policy-file=example.rego\n\n\nThis step requires sudo access because the Docker plugin framework will attempt to update the Docker daemon configuration. If you run without sudo you may encounter a permission error.\n\n 7. Reconfigure Docker.\nDocker must include the following command-line argument:\n--authorization-plugin=opa-docker-authz\n\nOn Ubuntu 16.04 with systemd, this can be done as follows (requires root):\n$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d\n$ sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf > /dev/null \nIf you are using a different Linux distribution or you are not running systemd, the process will be slightly different.\n8. Run a simple Docker command to make sure everything is still working.\n$ docker ps\n\nIf everything is setup correctly, the command should exit successfully. You can expect to see log messages from OPA and the plugin.\n9. Test that the policy definition is working.\nLet’s modify our policy to deny all requests:\n$ cat >example.rego \nIn OPA, rules defines the content of documents (for example, objects, arrays, strings, booleans, and so on).\nIn steps above, we created a rule named allow_request that defines a document that is the boolean value true. When all of the expressions on the body of the rule evaluate to true, we say the document is defined. If any of the expressions evaluate to false, we say the document is undefined. In this case, the document will always be undefined because the body of the rule is false.\n$ docker ps\n\nThe output should be:\nError response from daemon: authorization denied by plugin opa-docker-authz: request rejected by administrative policy\nTo learn more about how rules define the content of documents, see: How Does OPA Work?\nWith this policy in place, users will not be able to run any Docker commands. Go ahead and try other commands such as docker run or docker pull. They will all be rejected.\nNow let's change the policy so that it's a bit more useful.\n10. Update the policy to reject requests with the unconfined seccomp profile:\n$ cat >example.rego \nThe opa-docker-authz plugin is watching the policy definition file for changes. Each time we change the file, the plugin reads the file and sends it to OPA. To manually send the policy to OPA, you can use the following API:\n$ curl -X PUT --data-binary @example.rego http://localhost:8181/v1/policies/example_policy\n\nThis API is idempotent so sending the policy multiple times is fine. Go ahead and try it yourself.\n11. Test the policy is working by running a simple container:\n$ docker run hello-world\n\nNow try running the same container but disable seccomp (which should be prevented by the policy):\n$ docker run --security-opt seccomp:unconfined hello-world\n\nWhen Docker processes the run command, it contacts the plugin to see if the request should be allowed. The plugin takes the request and executes a query against OPA using the request as input data to the query. The same API call that the plugin makes can be executed using curl:\n$ curl -i -d '{\"input\": {\"Body\":{\"HostConfig\":{\"SecurityOpt\":[\"seccomp:unconfined\"]}}}}' \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    http://localhost:8181/v1/data/opa/example/allow_request\n\nBecause the document generated by the allow_request rule is undefined in this\ncase, the response object does not include a value for the document.\nYou can re-run the same query with the default seccomp profile and see that it succeeds:\n$ curl -i -d '{\"input\": {\"Body\":{\"HostConfig\":{\"SecurityOpt\":[\"seccomp:default\"]}}}}' \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    http://localhost:8181/v1/data/opa/example/allow_request\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully prevented containers from running without seccomp!\nSo far, the policy has been defined in terms of input data from the plugin. In many cases, it's necessary to write policies against multiple data sources.\nThe rest of the tutorial shows how you can grant fine grained access to specific clients. To do so, we will insert fake user data into OPA to simulate an authentication system.\n 12. Identify the user in Docker requests.\n\nBack up your existing Docker configuration, just in case. You can replace your original configuration after you are done with the tutorial.\n\n$ mkdir -p ~/.docker\n$ cp ~/.docker/config.json ~/.docker/config.json~\n\nTo identify the user, include an HTTP header in all of the requests sent to the Docker daemon:\n$ cat >~/.docker/config.json \nDocker does not currently provide a way to authenticate clients. But in Docker 1.12, clients can be authenticated using TLS and there are plans to include other means of authentication. For the purpose of this tutorial, we assume that an authentication system is place.\n13. Add user data directly to OPA.\n$ cat >users.json \nThis data represents information about users that could either come from an external system or be included in policy definitions.\nTo see that the user data has been added, we can query the Data API. This shows the properties associated with the user \"alice\":\n$ curl http://localhost:8181/v1/data/users/alice\n\n14. Update the policy to include basic user access controls.\n$ cat >example.rego \nIn the new policy, the valid_user_role rules reference the \"users\" document created in the previous step.\n15. Attempt to run a container.\nBecause the configured user is \"bob\", the request is rejected:\n$ docker run hello-world\n\n16. Change the user to \"alice\" and re-run the container.\n$ cat > ~/.docker/config.json \nBecause the configured user is \"alice\", the request will succeed:\n$ docker run hello-world\n\n17. Restore your original configuration.\nSee: “Reconfigure Docker.” and “Identify the user in Docker requests.”.\nThat's it!\n"},"http-api-authorization.html":{"url":"http-api-authorization.html","title":"HTTP API Authorization","keywords":"","body":"HTTP API Authorization\nAnything that exposes an HTTP API (whether an individual microservice or an application as a whole) needs to control who can run those APIs and when.

Check that bob CANNOT see charlie's salary.\nbob is not charlie's manager, so the following command will fail.\ncurl --user bob:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/charlie\n\n6. Change the policy.\nSuppose the organization now includes an HR department. The organization wants\nmembers of HR to be able to see any salary.

In real-world scenarios that information would be imported\nfrom external data sources.\n7. Check that the new policy works.\nCheck that david can see anyone's salary.\ncurl --user david:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/alice\ncurl --user david:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/bob\ncurl --user david:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/charlie\ncurl --user david:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/david\n\n8. (Optional) Use JSON Web Tokens to communicate policy data.\nOPA supports the parsing of JSON Web Tokens via the builtin function io.jwt.decode.\nTo get a sense of one way the subordinate and HR data might be communicated in the\nreal world, let's try a similar exercise utilizing the JWT utilities of OPA.\nShut down your docker-compose instance from before with ^C and then restart it to\nensure you are working with a fresh instance of OPA.\nThen update the policy:\ncat >example.rego \nAnd load it into OPA:\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @example.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/example\n\nFor convenience, we'll want to store user tokens in environment variables (they're really long).\nexport ALICE_TOKEN=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiYWxpY2UiLCJhenAiOiJhbGljZSIsInN1Ym9yZGluYXRlcyI6W10sImhyIjpmYWxzZX0.rz3jTY033z-NrKfwrK89_dcLF7TN4gwCMj-fVBDyLoM\"\nexport BOB_TOKEN=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiYm9iIiwiYXpwIjoiYm9iIiwic3Vib3JkaW5hdGVzIjpbImFsaWNlIl0sImhyIjpmYWxzZX0.n_lXN4H8UXGA_fXTbgWRx8b40GXpAGQHWluiYVI9qf0\"\nexport CHARLIE_TOKEN=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiY2hhcmxpZSIsImF6cCI6ImNoYXJsaWUiLCJzdWJvcmRpbmF0ZXMiOltdLCJociI6ZmFsc2V9.EZd_y_RHUnrCRMuauY7y5a1yiwdUHKRjm9xhVtjNALo\"\nexport BETTY_TOKEN=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiYmV0dHkiLCJhenAiOiJiZXR0eSIsInN1Ym9yZGluYXRlcyI6WyJjaGFybGllIl0sImhyIjpmYWxzZX0.TGCS6pTzjrs3nmALSOS7yiLO9Bh9fxzDXEDiq1LIYtE\"\nexport DAVID_TOKEN=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiZGF2aWQiLCJhenAiOiJkYXZpZCIsInN1Ym9yZGluYXRlcyI6W10sImhyIjp0cnVlfQ.Q6EiWzU1wx1g6sdWQ1r4bxT1JgSHUpVXpINMqMaUDMU\"\n\nThese tokens encode the same information as the policies we did before (bob is alice's manager, betty is charlie's, david is the only HR member, etc).\nIf you want to inspect their contents, start up the OPA REPL and execute io.jwt.decode(, header, payload, signature).\nLet's try a few queries (note: you may need to escape the ? characters in the queries for your shell):\nCheck that charlie can't see bob's salary.\ncurl --user charlie:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/bob?token=$CHARLIE_TOKEN\n\nCheck that charlie can't pretend to be bob to see alice's salary.\ncurl --user charlie:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/alice?token=$BOB_TOKEN\n\nCheck that david can see betty's salary.\ncurl --user david:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/betty?token=$DAVID_TOKEN\n\nCheck that bob can see alice's salary.\ncurl --user bob:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/alice?token=$BOB_TOKEN\n\nCheck that alice can see her own salary.\ncurl --user alice:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/alice?token=$ALICE_TOKEN\n\nWrap Up\nCongratulations for finishing the tutorial!\nYou learned a number of things about API authorization with OPA:\n\nOPA gives you fine-grained policy control over APIs once you set up the\nserver to ask OPA for authorization.\nYou write allow/deny policies to control which APIs can be executed by whom.\nYou can import external data into OPA and write policies that depend on\nthat data.\nYou can use OPA data structures to define abstractions over your data.\n\nThe code for this tutorial can be found in the\nopen-policy-agent/contrib\nrepository.\n"},"ssh-and-sudo-authorization.html":{"url":"ssh-and-sudo-authorization.html","title":"SSH and sudo Authorization","keywords":"","body":"SSH and sudo Authorization\nHost-level access controls are an important part of every organization's\nsecurity strategy.

In this case, we have created an OPA-based plugin that can\nbe configured to authorize SSH and sudo access. The OPA-based Linux-PAM plugin\nused in this tutorial can be found at open-policy-agent/contrib.\nFor this tutorial, our desired policy is:\n\nAdmins can SSH into any host and run sudo commands.\nNormal users can SSH into hosts that they have contributed to.\nNormal users cannot run sudo commands.\n\nFurthermore, we'll assume we have the following set of users and hosts:\n\nfrontend-dev is a developer who contributes to the app running on the frontend host.\nbackend-dev is a developer who contributes to the app running on the backend host.\nops is an administrator for the organization.\n\nAuthentication (verifying user identity) is outside the scope of OPA's\nresponsibility so this tutorial relies on identities being statically\ndefined. In real-world scenarios authentication can be delegated to SSH itself\n(authorized_keys) or other identity management systems.\nLet's get started.\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires Docker Compose to run dummy SSH hosts along\nwith OPA. The dummy SSH hosts are just containers running sshd inside.\nSteps\n1. Bootstrap the tutorial environment using Docker Compose.\nFirst, create a docker-compose.yml file that runs OPA and the containers that\nrepresent our backend and frontend hosts.\ncat > docker-compose.yml \nThe docker-compose.yml file requires two other local files:\nfrontend_host_id.json and backend_host_id.json. These files are mounted\ninto the containers representing our hosts. The content of the file provides\ncontext that the PAM module provides as input when executing queries\nagainst OPA.\nCreate the extra files required by docker-compose.yml:\necho '{\"host_id\": \"frontend\"}' > frontend_host_id.json\necho '{\"host_id\": \"backend\"}' > backend_host_id.json\n\n\nIn real-world scenarios, these files could contain arbitrary infomration that we want to expose to the policy.\n\nFinally, run docker-compose to pull and run the containers.\ndocker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up\n\n2. Load policies and data into OPA.\nIn another terminal, load the policies and data into OPA that will control access to the hosts.\nFirst, create the policy that will control SSH access to hosts.\ncat >ssh_authz.rego \nPush this policy into OPA:\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @ssh_authz.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/ssh_authz\n\nNext, create the policy that will control sudo access on the hosts.\ncat >sudo_authz.rego \nPush this policy into OPA:\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @sudo_authz.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/sudo_authz\n\nFinally, load the data that represents our roles and contributors into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT localhost:8181/v1/data/roles -d \\\n'{\n    \"admin\": [\"ops\"]\n}'\n\ncurl -X PUT localhost:8181/v1/data/hosts -d \\\n'{\n  \"frontend\": {\n    \"contributors\": [\n      \"frontend-dev\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"backend\": {\n    \"contributors\": [\n      \"backend-dev\"\n    ]\n  }\n}'\n\n3. Prepare SSH key to login to hosts.\nThis tutorial uses a special Docker image named openpolicyagent/demo-pam to simulate an SSH server. This image contains:\n\nPre-created Linux accounts for our users.\nPre-populated authorized_keys files for our users.\n\nYou must have the correct private key to SSH into the containers. Run the\nfollowing command to write the private key to a local file:\ncat >ssh_authz.key \nSet the file permissions on the private key.\nchmod 600 ssh_authz.key\n\n4. SSH and sudo as a user with the admin role.\nFirst, let's try to access the hosts as the ops user. Recall, the ops user\nhas been granted the admin role (via the PUT /data/roles request above) and\nusers with the admin role can login to any host and perform sudo commands.\nLogin to the frontend host (which has SSH listening on port 2222) and run a command with sudo as the ops user.\nssh -p 2222 ops@localhost \\\n  -i ssh_authz.key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\nsudo ls /\nexit\n\n5. SSH as a user without the admin role.\nLet's try a user without the admin role. Recall, that a non-admin user can SSH\ninto any host that they have contributed to.\nThe frontend-dev user contributed code to the frontend host so they should be\nable to login.\nssh -p 2222 frontend-dev@localhost \\\n  -i ssh_authz.key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\n\nHowever, since frontend-dev is not an admin, they cannot run sudo commands.\nsudo ls /\nexit\n\nFurthermore, since frontend-dev did not contribute to the code running on the\nbackend host (which has SSH listening on port 2223), they should not be able\nto login.\nssh -p 2223 frontend-dev@localhost \\\n  -i ssh_authz.key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\n\n6. Elevate a user's rights through policy.\nSuppose a user needs to be temporarily granted extra privileges. E.g., the user\nmay need to debug an issue on a specific production host. In this case, we can\nadd an another policy to temporarily allow this.\nLet's allow the frontend-dev user to run sudo commands on the frontend host.\ncat >sudo_authz_special.rego \nLoad this policy into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @sudo_authz_special.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/sudo_authz_special\n\nConfirm that the user frontend-dev can login to the frontend host and run sudo commands.\nssh -p 2222 frontend-dev@localhost \\\n  -i ssh_authz.key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\nsudo ls /\nexit\n\nLastly, remove the policy from OPA and confirm the user's original rights are restored.\ncurl -i -X DELETE localhost:8181/v1/policies/sudo_authz_special\n\nssh -p 2222 frontend-dev@localhost \\\n  -i ssh_authz.key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\nsudo ls /\nexit\n\nWrap Up\nCongratulations for finishing the tutorial!\n You learned a number of things about SSH with OPA:\n\nOPA gives you fine-grained policy control over SSH and sudo on any host where you've\ninstalled OPA and its PAM module.\nYou write allow/deny policies to control who has access to what.\nYou can import external data into OPA and write policies that depend on.\nthat data.\n\nThe code for this tutorial can be found in the\nopen-policy-agent/contrib\nrepository.\n"}}}
